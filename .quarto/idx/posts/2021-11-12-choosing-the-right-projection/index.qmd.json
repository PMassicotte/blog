[There are plenty of projections to choose from](https://www.geo-projections.com/), and [none can be qualified as the best one](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/map-projections). It all depends on what you are trying to achieve. Websites like [the projection wizard website](https://projectionwizard.org/) offer a playground to experiment with different projections and how they look like depending on where you are looking at on the globe.\n\n![A medieval depiction of the Ecumene (1482, Johannes Schnitzer, engraver), constructed after the coordinates in Ptolemy's Geography and using his second map projection](img/preview.png)\n\n<small>Image from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection</small>\n\nThe goal of this blog post is not to go into details and consideration on how to choose *a good* projection (it is out of my expertise), but rather present a quick overview of the `crsuggest` [R package](https://github.com/walkerke/crsuggest) that can help to find a projection suited for the data to be displayed.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nlibrary(crsuggest)\n```\n\n```{r}\nmap <- ne_countries(country = \"greenland\", returnclass = \"sf\", scale = \"medium\")\n\n# Looks at the projection\nst_crs(map)$proj4string\n```\n\nWe can see that WGS84 is used as the reference coordinate system. Plotting the shapefile immediately shows that the result is somewhat distorted.\n\n```{r}\np1 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = map)\n\np1\n```\n\nTime to look at the `crsuggest` package. The function `suggest_crs()` takes a spatial dataset as inputs (here the `map` object) and return a list (*n = 10* by default) of suggested coordinate systems in a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/).\n\n```{r}\nsuggested_crs <- suggest_crs(map, limit = 3)\nsuggested_crs\n```\n\nLet's make some plots using the suggested CRS.\n\n```{r}\nplot_map <- function(crs, map) {\n  ggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data = map) +\n    coord_sf(crs = as.numeric(crs)) +\n    labs(\n      title = paste(\"CRS:\", crs)\n    )\n}\n\nmaps <- lapply(suggested_crs$crs_code, plot_map, map = map)\n```\n\nWe can see that the projected maps look more accurate than the original map.\n\n```{r}\nwrap_plots(maps, ncol = 3)\n```\n\nThis is even more obvious when they are compared side by side.\n\n```{r, compare_crs}\np2 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = map) +\n  coord_sf(crs = 5922)\n\np1 + p2\n```\n\n<details>\n  \n<summary>Session info</summary>\n\n```{r sessioninfo, echo = FALSE}\n## Reproducibility info\noptions(width = 120)\ndevtools::session_info()\n```\n\n</details>\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":8,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"png","fig-dpi":600,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"center","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"highlight-style":"arrow","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","knitr":{"opts_chunk":{"collapse":true,"comment":"#>"}},"comments":{"utterances":{"repo":"pmassicotte/PMassicotte.github.io"}},"theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"mainfont":"Montserrat","fig-asp":0.618,"title-block-banner":true,"title":"Choosing the right geographic projection with the crsuggest R package","author":"Philippe Massicotte","date":"2021-11-12","categories":["R","Geospatial"],"image":"img/preview.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
