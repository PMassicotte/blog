Recently, I had to make a `ggplot2` graphic with data that contained dates. Let's create some sample data with dates.

```{r}
n <- 10

df <- tibble(
  x = seq(as.Date("2020-01-01"), as.Date("2020-10-10"), length.out = n),
  y = rnorm(n)
)

df

p <- df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 weeks", date_labels = "%B-%d")

p
```

My Linux system is configured in English, the dates are also displayed in English in the above graphic. If we want to use another language, we first have to edit the `/etc/locale.gen` file and un-comment the line(s) for the language(s) we want to use. For this particular example, I wanted to display the dates in French.

``` {.bash}
sudo nano /etc/locale.gen
```

![My locale.gen configuration file.](img/locale_gen.png)

In this file, I un-commented the `fr_CA.UTF-8 UTF-8` line. Once done, save the file. Then, we have to regenerate the localization files using the `locale-gen` function.

``` {.bash}
sudo locale-gen fr_CA.UTF-8
```

Finally, within R, we can set the locale language with `Sys.setlocale()`. If we call the plot again, the dates are now displayed in French as expected.

```{r}
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "fr_CA.UTF-8")
p
```
