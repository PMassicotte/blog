I am using `renv` quite a lot. Recently, I had to return to an older project that was using this package to manage package dependencies. When I tried to load `tidyverse`, I got the following message:

``` r
> library(tidyverse)
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘tidyverse’ in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
  unable to load shared object '/home/xxx/.local/share/renv/cache/v5/R-4.2/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/stringi/1.7.6/bba431031d30789535745a9627ac9271/stringi/libs/stringi.so':
  libicui18n.so.66: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

This [means](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/309) that `stringi` v1.7.6 (a dependency for the `tidyverse`) was originally compiled with a certain version of `libicui18n`, and that after a system update/upgrade on my Ubuntu computer, this file no longer exists. One solution to fix this is to rebuild the `stringi` package using the new version of `libicui18n` installed on your computer. To do so, you can use `renv::install(package_name@version)` to specify a specific version of an R package to be installed/compiled.

```{r}
#| eval: false
renv::install(
  "stringi@1.7.6",
  rebuild = TRUE,
  repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/"
)
```

`stringi@1.7.6` means to install version 1.7.6 of the package, the same version that was included in the `renv.lock` file. After this operation, you should be able to do `library(tidyverse)` without problems.

If for whatever reason you have to change to a specific version of an R package, you can use `renv::record()` to modify the `renv.lock` file:

```{r}
#| eval: false
renv::record("stringi@1.7.8")
```
