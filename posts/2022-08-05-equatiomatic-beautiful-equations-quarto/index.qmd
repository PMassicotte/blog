When writing dynamic documents in R (either R Markdown or Quarto), it can be useful to display model equations. I recently discovered [equatiomatic](https://datalorax.github.io/equatiomatic/), a very nice package that can do the job.

The package can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages("equatiomatic")`. To explore the package's functionalities, we will build a simple linear model using `mtcars` data (most examples are taken from the [equatiomatic vignette website](https://datalorax.github.io/equatiomatic/)).

```{r}
library(equatiomatic)

# Create a simple linear model
mod2 <- lm(mpg ~ ., mtcars)
```

```{r}
broom::tidy(mod2)
```

There are different ways to display the model equation. The most basic way is to call the `extract_eq()` function. This will display the equation _without_ the fitted coefficients.

```{r}
extract_eq(mod2)
```

As we can see, this equation is pretty long. It would be best to wrap it over multiple lines. This can be controlled using `wrap = TRUE`.

```{r}
extract_eq(mod2, wrap = TRUE)
```

The number of terms per line is controlled with `terms_per_line`.

```{r}
extract_eq(mod2, wrap = TRUE, terms_per_line = 2)
```

There is a lot of styling customization that can be performed.

```{r}
extract_eq(mod2, wrap = TRUE, greek_colors = "red", subscript_colors = "blue")
```

One can use `use_coefs = TRUE` to extract the fitted coefficients.

```{r}
extract_eq(mod2, wrap = TRUE, use_coefs = TRUE)
```

Many types of models are supported by `equatiomatic`. Further information can be found on the [equatiomatic](https://datalorax.github.io/equatiomatic/) website.
