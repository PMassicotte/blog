  abstract = {Trends and variability in the hydrological regime were analyzed for the Mackenzie River Basin in northern Canada. The procedure utilized the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test to detect trends, the Trend Free Pre-Whitening (TFPW) approach for correcting time-series data for autocorrelation and a bootstrap resampling method to account for the cross-correlation structure of the data. A total of 19 hydrological and six meteorological variables were selected for the study. Analysis was conducted on hydrological data from a network of 54 hydrometric stations and meteorological data from a network of 10 stations. The results indicated that several hydrological variables exhibit a greater number of significant trends than are expected to occur by chance. Noteworthy were strong increasing trends over the winter month flows of December to April as well as in the annual minimum flow and weak decreasing trends in the early summer and late fall flows as well as in the annual mean flow. An earlier onset of the spring freshet is noted over the basin. The results are expected to assist water resources managers and policy makers in making better planning decisions in the Mackenzie River Basin. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

Starting from the multiplicative speckle and texture models relating the amount of texture and speckle to the local mean and variance at every pixel, such a feature is rigorously derived from Shannon's information theory as the conditional information of local standard deviation to local mean. Thanks to robust statistical estimation, it is very little sensitive to the noise affecting SAR data, and thus capable of capturing subtle variations of texture whenever they are embedded in a heavy speckle. Experimental results carried out on two SAR images with different degrees of noisiness demonstrate that the proposed feature is likely to be useful for a variety of automated segmentation and classification tasks.},

However, from a regional perspective, it is not known whether conserving multiple sets of interconnected habitat patches would include more species (i.e., show higher gamma diversity) than conserving multiple, unconnected, solitary patches. We studied aquatic macrophytes in 15 sets of unidirectionally interconnected ponds and 19 unconnected ponds and also tested whether alpha and beta diversity, expressed as the number of species and dissimilarity in species composition, respectively, differed between connected and unconnected ponds. We found that c diversity was higher in connected ponds than in unconnected ponds, even after controlling for surface area. This resulted from a higher a diversity in connected ponds, despite lower b diversity. These results suggest that connections between habitat patches positively influence diversity at both local and regional scales. When the total surface area available for conservation is limited, interconnected habitat patches should be preferentially conserved.},

The extracellular HMW DOM produced in these cultures was isolated by ultrafiltration and characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and molecular level analyses. All species exude DOM rich in polysaccharides, and the exudates of T. weissflogii and E. huxleyi closely resemble acyl heteropolysaccharides (APS) previously identified as major constituents of naturally occurring marine HMW DOM. Degradation of the T. weissflogii exudate alters the chemical composition of the DOM, which we attribute to differences in the reactivity of specific polysaccharides. The component within the exudate that most resembles seawater DOM has a slower degradation rate relative to the total polysaccharide fraction. Our study indicates that APS isolated from the surface ocean can have a direct algal source and that APS may accumulate in seawater as a result of its metabolic resistance.},

We hypothesize that seasonal changes in DOC quality, related to the flood pulse, drive the effects of light-DOC interactions on uptake by planktonic bacteria uptake in clear-water Amazonian ecosystems. Water samples from two ecosystems (one lake and one stream) were incubated in sunlight during different hydrological periods and were then exposed to bacterial degradation. Photochemical and bacterial degradation were driven by seasonal DOC inputs. Bacterial mineralization was the main degradation pathway of autochthonous DOC in the lake, while allochthonous DOC was more available for photochemical oxidation. We suggest that sunlight enhances the bacterial uptake of refractory DOC but does not alter uptake of labile forms. We also observed a positive relationship between sunlight and bacterial degradation of DOC, instead of competition. We conclude that photochemical reactions and bacteria complementarily degrade the different sources of DOC during the flood pulse in Amazonian clear-water aquatic ecosystems.},

This study provided evidence that higher structural complexity of seagrass bed was related to the higher richness, abundance, and biomass of fish. However, lower structural complexity of seagrass patch should not be underestimated because it provided different habitat for various stages of life in fish. Smaller fish preferred to occupy dense seagrass of dominant pioneer small-sized species (Halodule uninervis) and moved to the lesser dense bed of climax large-sized seagrass (Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides) with increasing their size.

There was no relationship between percent cover of sub-ice algae and physical factors at the kilometer scale, but at the scale of individual ice floes the percent cover of sub-ice algae was positively correlated with distance from the floe edge and negatively correlated with snow depth. A significant positive relationship between the concentration of sediment pigments and percent cover of sub-ice could indicate a coupling between ice algal and benthic systems. Pieces of ice algae that appeared to be Melosira were observed on the seafloor to a depth of over 100 m and cells or spores of obligate ice algal taxa were collected from sediments from 44-m to 1,000-m deep. The large biomass of sub-ice algae observed at many stations in the Chukchi Sea and the presence of ice algae on the seafloor indicates that the distribution and abundance of sub-ice algae needs to be understood if we are to evaluate the role of ice algae in the Arctic marine ecosystem.},

Surface ({$<$}100 m) concentrations of DOC ranged from 60 to 118 {$\mu$}M with elevated values in the East Greenland Current (EGC) which transports water from the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic. EGC surface waters also showed a pronounced fluorescence maximum between 30 and 120 m depth in all EGC sections indicating the abundance of Arctic river derived DOC in this current. Based on fluorescence we estimated that 20-50\% of the annual river discharge to the Arctic Ocean was exported in the EGC. The fluorescence maximum was typically associated with salinity around 33 and temperatures below - 1\textdegree C which are characteristic of surface and upper halocline water in the Arctic Ocean. The elevated fluorescence in this water mass suggests a strong Eurasian shelf component and also suggests that in situ fluorescence could be used to trace Eurasian shelf water in the central Arctic Ocean. DOC concentrations in the Nordic Sea basins ({$>$}1000 m) were relatively high ({$\sim$}50 {$\mu$}M DOC) compared with other ocean basins indicating active vertical transport of DOC in this region on decadal timescales. Based on existing vertical transport estimates and 15 {$\mu$}M of semilabile DOC we calculated an annual vertical net DOC export of 3.5 Tg C yr-1 in the Greenland Sea and about 36 Tg C yr-1 for the entire Arctic Mediterranean Sea (AMS) including the Greenland-Scotland Ridge overflow. It appears that physical processes play a determining role for the distribution of DOC in the AMS.},

  abstract = {1. Dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) concentration was determined for a range of lakes of varying conductivity (30-4000 mu S cm(-1)) in the low Arctic of SW Greenland. DOC concentration range from {$<$} 1 to {$>$} 100 mg CL-1, occasionally approaching 200 mg CL-1 in meromictic, oligosaline lakes. DOC concentration was strongly related to [log(10)] conductivity and total nitrogen. 2. Peak DOC concentrations ({$>$} 80 mg L-1) occur in lakes located approximately 50 km from the present ice sheet margin, a zone of low effective precipitation; evaporative concentration is the first-order control on DOC concentration. Lakes at the coast and closer to the ice margin had lower DOC concentrations ({$<$} 20 mg C L-1). Local factors, notably the presence or absence of an outflow and catchment morphometry, resulted in considerable variability in concentration (20-100 mg CL-1) within the area of maximum concentration around 51 degrees W. 3. Despite their high DOC concentration, these lakes are essentially colourless. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) absorption (a(375)) was low in most lakes ({$<$} 10 m(-1)) with maximum values (approximately 20 m(-1)) occurring in one humic-stained lake in the area. Absorption values corrected for DOC concentration (a(375)(*)) were very low ({$<$} 0.6 m(2) g(-1) C) for all lakes apart from those at the coast, perhaps reflecting greater allochthonous inputs at these sites. 4. S, the spectral slope coefficient, ranged from 16 to 27 mu m(-1) and was weakly correlated with DOC concentration. Both a(375) and S showed similar distribution patterns along the sampling gradient as did DOC, with maximum values at approximately 51 degrees W. High a(375)(*) and low S may indicate fresher, more rapidly flushed, systems with less degraded DOM or greater inputs from their catchments. 5. The lakes closer to the head of the fjord with higher conductivity, had low a*(375) ({$<$} 0.2 m(2) g(-1) C) and high S ({$>$} 21 mu m(-1)) and this may reflect increasingly longer lake water residence times, greater DOM age and photochemical degradation.},

  abstract = {Many hypotheses have been proposed to account for geographic variations in species diversity. In general these relate to some aspect of climate, particularly climatic variables measuring available or potential energy, but while these relate directly to plant diversity they may only indirectly affect mammal species richness. We have examined these relationships by mapping and correlating mammal species richness in southern Africa (n=285 species) with 15 climatic variables, two topographic variables, and woody plant species richness (n=1359 species). The effect of area on richness was held a constant by using an equal-area grid cell matrix superimposed on species range maps, with each grid cell equal to 25 000 km2. We found that variability in the plant species richness alone accounts for 75\% of the variability in mammal species richness. Of the climatic variables, only thermal seasonality approaches this figure, accounting for 69\% of the variability, while annual measures of temperature, precipitation or energy account for only 14-35\% of variability. Differences from North American mammal diversity studies, where annual temperature, and hence annual potential evapotranspiration (PET), have been found to be more important, are attributed in part to southern Africa's climate and vegetation being largely temperate to tropical, as opposed to temperate to polar in North America. By distinguishing different types of mammal based on size, spatial and dietary guilds, other differences emerge. Strong correlations with annual temperature exist only for large mammals, accounting for 60-67\% of the variability in species richness of large mammals compared with {$<$}20\% for small mammals. Small mammals are strongly correlated with other climatic or vegetation parameters, especially plant richness and thermal seasonality; frugivorous and insectivorous mammal richness is correlated with thermal seasonality and minimum monthly PET; and arboreal and aerial species richness is correlated with plant richness, thermal seasonality and minimum monthly PET. Up to 77\% of the variability in richness of arboreal, frugivorous and insectivorous species can be explained by woody plant richness, compared with only 38-48\% of the variability in terrestrial herbivores. It is clear from this that different kinds of mammals are differentially affected by climatic and environmental factors, and this explains some of the discrepancies found in earlier studies where no distinction was made between different sizes or guilds of mammal. This result has implications both for the conservation of mammalian communities at the present time and for understanding the evolution and structure of mammalian communities in the past.},

Aqueous solutions of HSs from diverse aquatic environments representing different dissolved organic matter sources (autochthonous and allochthonous) were exposed to artificial solar UV radiation. These solutions were added to lake water passed through a 0.7-microm-pore-size filter (containing grazer-free lake bacteria) followed by dark incubation for 5, 43, and 65 h. For the 5-h incubation, several irradiated HSs inhibited bacterial carbon production (BCP) and this inhibition was highly correlated with H2O2 photoproduction. The H2O2 decayed in the dark, and after 43 h, nearly all irradiated HSs enhanced BCP (average 39\% increase relative to nonirradiated controls, standard error = 7.5\%, n = 16). UV exposure of HSs also increased bacterial respiration (by approximately 18\%, standard error = 5\%, n = 4), but less than BCP, resulting in an average increase in BGE of 32\% (standard error = 10\%, n = 4). Photoenhancement of BCP did not correlate to HS bulk properties (i.e., elemental and chemical composition). However, when the photoenhancement of BCP was normalized to absorbance, several trends with HS origin and extraction method emerged. Absorbance-normalized hydrophilic acid and humic acid samples showed greater enhancement of BCP than hydrophobic acid and fulvic acid samples. Furthermore, absorbance-normalized autochthonous samples showed approximately 10-fold greater enhancement of BCP than allochthonous-dominated samples, indicating that the former are more efficient photoproducers of biological substrates.},

In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G: statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identifiy ``outliers,'' as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial eualuation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of confict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations},

The final goal of this work is to establish a baseline for a global, multiyear, multisensor ocean color record, to be built from observations of past ( i.e., CZCS), present, and future missions. To produce an internally consistent time series, the same revised algorithms also have been applied to the first 5 years of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor ( SeaWiFS) ocean color observations ( 1998-2002). Such a database is necessary in order to determine whether or not the ocean biogeochemistry has evolved in the past years and, if so, to be able to detect near future trends. Algorithmic and calibration aspects, along with validation results presented in this paper, are tailored toward the identification of long-term trends, which mandated this reprocessing effort. The analysis of decadal changes from the CZCS to the SeaWiFS era shows an overall increase of the world ocean average chlorophyll concentration by about 22\%, mainly due to large increases in the intertropical areas, where the seasonal cycles also substantially changed over the past 2 decades. Increases in higher latitudes, where seasonal cycles did not change, contribute to a lesser extent to the general trend. In contrast, oligotrophic gyres display declining concentrations.},

The camera design is described, as well as the main steps of its optical and radiometric characterization and calibration. The results show the excellent optical quality of the specifically designed fish-eye objective. They also show the low noise and excellent linearity of the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) detector array that is used. Initial results obtained in various oceanic environments demonstrate the potential of this instrument to provide new measurements of the underwater radiance distribution from the sea surface to dimly lit layers at depth. Excellent agreement is obtained between nadir radiances measured with the camera and commercial radiometers. Comparison of the upwelling radiance distributions measured with the CE600 and those obtained with another radiance camera also shows a very close agreement. The CE600 measurements allow all apparent optical properties (AOPs) to be determined from integration of the radiance distributions and inherent optical properties (IOPs) to be determined from inversion of the AOPs. This possibility represents a significant advance for marine optics by tying all optical properties to the radiometric standard and avoiding the deployment of complex instrument packages to collect AOPs and IOPs simultaneously (except when it comes to partitioning IOPs into their component parts).}

  abstract = {Abstract. A data set of radiometric measurements collected in the Beaufort Sea (Canadian Arctic) in August 2009 (Malina project) is analyzed in order to describe apparent optical properties (AOPs) in this sea, which has been subject to dramatic environmental changes for several decades. The two properties derived from the measurements are the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance, Kd, and the spectral remote sensing reflectance, Rrs. The former controls light propagation in the upper water column. The latter determines how light is backscattered out of the water and becomes eventually observable from a satellite ocean color sensor. The data set includes offshore clear waters of the Beaufort Basin as well as highly turbid waters of the Mackenzie River plumes. In the clear waters, we show Kd values that are much larger in the ultraviolet and blue parts of the spectrum than what could be anticipated considering the chlorophyll concentration. A larger contribution of absorption by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is responsible for these high Kd values, as compared to other oligotrophic areas. In turbid waters, attenuation reaches extremely high values, driven by high loads of particulate materials and also by a large CDOM content. In these two extreme types of waters, current satellite chlorophyll algorithms fail. This questions the role of ocean color remote sensing in the Arctic when Rrs from only the blue and green bands are used. Therefore, other parts of the spectrum (e.g., the red) should be explored if one aims at quantifying interannual changes in chlorophyll in the Arctic from space. The very peculiar AOPs in the Beaufort Sea also advocate for developing specific light propagation models when attempting to predict light availability for photosynthesis at depth.},

Tens of thousands of distinct molecular species are identified, providing clues to the nature and sources of organic carbon in Antarctica. We show that many of the identified supraglacial organic matter formulas are consistent with material from microbial sources, and terrestrial inputs of vascular plant-derived materials are likely more important sources of organic carbon to Antarctica than previously thought. Black carbon-like material apparently originating from biomass burning in South America is also present, while a smaller fraction originated from soil humics and appears to be photochemically or microbially modified. In addition to remote continental sources, we document signals of oceanic emissions of primary aerosols and secondary organic aerosol precursors. The new insights on the diversity of organic species in Antarctic snowpack reinforce the importance of studying organic carbon associated with the Earth's polar regions in the face of changing climate.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Predicting water-column phytoplankton biomass from near-surface measurements is a common approach in biological oceanography, particularly since the advent of satellite remote sensing of ocean color (OC). In the Arctic Ocean, deep subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCMs) that significantly contribute to primary production (PP) are often observed. These are neither detected by ocean color sensors nor accounted for in the primary production models applied to the Arctic Ocean. Here, we assemble a large database of pan-Arctic observations (i.e., 5206 stations) and develop an empirical model to estimate vertical chlorophyll a (Chl a) according to (1) the shelf\textendash offshore gradient delimited by the 50 m isobath, (2) seasonal variability along pre-bloom, post-bloom, and winter periods, and (3) regional differences across ten sub-Arctic and Arctic seas. Our detailed analysis of the dataset shows that, for the pre-bloom and winter periods, as well as for high surface Chl a concentration (Chl asurf; 0.7\textendash 30 mg m-3) throughout the open water period, the Chl a maximum is mainly located at or near the surface. Deep SCMs occur chiefly during the post-bloom period when Chl asurf is low (0\textendash 0.5 mg m-3). By applying our empirical model to annual Chl asurf time series, instead of the conventional method assuming vertically homogenous Chl a, we produce novel pan-Arctic PP estimates and associated uncertainties. Our results show that vertical variations in Chl a have a limited impact on annual depth-integrated PP. Small overestimates found when SCMs are shallow (i.e., pre-bloom, post-bloom {$>$} 0.7 mg m-3, and the winter period) somehow compensate for the underestimates found when SCMs are deep (i.e., post-bloom -3). SCMs are, however, important seasonal features with a substantial impact on depth-integrated PP estimates, especially when surface nitrate is exhausted in the Arctic Ocean and where highly stratified and oligotrophic conditions prevail.},

  abstract = {The contiguous Arctic shelf is the green belt of the Arctic Ocean. Phytoplankton dynamics in this environment are driven by extreme physical gradients and by rapid climate change, which influence light and nutrient availability as well as the growth and ecological characteristics of phytoplankton. A large dataset collected across the Canadian Beaufort Shelf during summer 2009 was analyzed to assess how the interplay of physical and biogeochemical conditions dictates phytoplankton niches and trophic regimes. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis demonstrated marked partitioning of phytoplankton diversity. Elevated phytoplankton biomass ({$\sim$} 2.41 {$\mu$}g Chl a L-1) was observed in association with the surface mixed layer near the coast, close to the mouth of the Mackenzie River, and at the shelf-break as a result of nutrient-rich Pacific water intrusions. The coastal communities were supported by high levels of nitrogen nutrients and were taxonomically uniform, with diatoms accounting for 95\% of total cell numbers. By contrast, adjacent oceanic waters were characterized by low autotrophic biomass near the surface ({$\sim$} 0.09 {$\mu$}g Chl a L-1) and below the mixed layer ({$\sim$} 0.23 {$\mu$}g Chl a L-1) due to mainly nutrient limitation. However, the oceanic community was more diverse with a mixed assemblage of diatoms and small mixotrophs/heterotrophs near the surface and a predominance of autotrophic nanoflagellates at depth. We conclude that as climate change intensifies freshening and stratification in the Western Arctic Ocean, coastal hotspots of high autotrophic productivity may play an even greater role in supporting Arctic marine ecosystems while offshore environments become increasingly oligotrophic.},

Here, we document a massive phytoplankton bloom beneath fully consolidated pack ice far from the ice edge in the Chukchi Sea, where light transmission has increased in recent decades because of thinning ice cover and proliferation of melt ponds. The bloom was characterized by high diatom biomass and rates of growth and primary production. Evidence suggests that under-ice phytoplankton blooms may be more widespread over nutrient-rich Arctic continental shelves and that satellite-based estimates of annual primary production in these waters may be underestimated by up to 10-fold.},

In this paper the authors propose a new preparative HPSEC method for various soil HAs. Three soil HAs with different chemical properties were fractionated by a Shodex OHpak SB-2004 HQ column with 10mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)/acetonitrile (3:1, v/v) as an eluent. The HAs eluted within a reasonable column range time (12-25 min) without peak tailing. Preparative HPSEC chromatograms of these HAs indicated that non-size-exclusion effects were suppressed. The separated fractions were analyzed by HPSEC to determine their apparent molecular weights. These decreased sequentially from fraction 1 to fraction 10, suggesting that the HAs had been separated by their molecular size. The size-separated fractions of the soil HA were mixed to compare them with unfractionated HA. The analytical HPSEC chromatogram of the mixed HA was almost identical to that of the unfractionated HA. It appears that the HAs do not adsorb specifically to the column during preparative HPSEC. Our preparative HPSEC method allows for rapid and reproducible separation of various soil HAs by molecular size.},

We studied four small unproductive lakes in subarctic northern Sweden during one summer season. The production of new biomass in both benthic and pelagic habitats was calculated as the sum of autotrophic production by algae and heterotrophic production by bacteria using allochthonous organic carbon (OC). Whole-lake production of new biomass was dominated by the benthic habitat (86\% +/- 4\% [mean +/- SD]) and by primary production (77\% +/- 9\%). Still, heterotrophic bacteria fueled by allochthonous OC constituted a significant portion of the new biomass production in both benthic (19\% +/- 11\%) and pelagic habitats (51\% +/- 24\%). In addition, overall net production (primary production minus respiration) was close to zero in the benthic habitats but highly negative (-163 +/- 81 mg C.m(-2).d(-1)) in pelagic regions of all lakes. We conclude (1) that allochthonous OC supported a significant part of total production of new biomass in both pelagic and benthic habitats, (2) that benthic habitats dominated the whole-lake production of new biomass, and (3) that respiration and net CO2 production dominated the carbon flux of the pelagic habitats and biomass production dominated the benthic carbon flux. Taken together, these findings suggest that previous investigations have greatly underestimated the productivity of clear-water lakes when benthic autotrophic production and metabolism of allochthonous OC have not been measured.},

CDOM absorption coefficient, a CDOM(375) values followed the trend in DOC concentrations across the salinity gradient and ranged from 1.67 to 33.4 m -1.

Bioassays of 12-18 d long durations were used in 3 seasons at in situ temperatures. Besides the bulk parameters, a suite of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality parameters were also investigated, including colored DOM (CDOM), fluorescent DOM and the molecular weight of DOM. Bioavailable DOC and DON pools varied significantly between the estuaries, from 7.9 to 10.6\% and from 5.5 to 21.9\%, respectively. DOM originating from the catchment dominated by natural forests and peatlands (Kiiminkijoki) had the lowest DOC and DON degradation rates, as well as the lowest proportions of biodegradable DOC and DON. A greater proportion of agricultural land in the catchment increased the bioavailability of DON, but not the bioavailability of DOC (Kyronjoki). Additionally, DOM quality varied significantly between the estuaries, and DOM originating from the agricultural Kyronjoki catchment sustained higher DOC and DON degradation rates and higher bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) compared to those of the natural forest and peat dominated Kiiminkijoki catchment. The quality of DOM, indicated by differences in CDOM, fluorescent DOM and molecular weight, varied between estuaries with differing land use and was concluded to be major driver of BGE of these systems and thereafter to the microbial CO sub(2) fluxes from the estuaries. The differences in BGE resulted in a 5-fold difference in the calculated daily bacterial CO sub(2) emissions between the study's estuaries due to bacterial activity, ranging from 40 kg C d super(-1) in the Karjaanjoki estuary to 200 kg C d super(-1) in the Kyronjoki estuary. Lower DOC:DON ratios, smaller molecular weight and higher CDOM absorption spectral slope values of DOM resulted in higher proportion of the initial DOC and DON being transferred to microbial growth and therefore to the pelagic food web. The pristine, peatland and forest-dominated Kiiminkijoki catchment had the lowest BGE, and therefore proportionally highest CO sub(2) fluxes.},

The river waters had been exposed to various degrees of bacterial degradation by storing them between 0 and 465 days in dark prior to the bioassay. The resulting predegraded DOM was inoculated with estuarine bacteria and the subsequent changes in DOM quantity and quality measured. During the incubations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and oxygen concentrations decreased, indicating heterotrophic activity. Coloured DOM was degraded less than DOC, indicating a selective utilization of DOM, and humic-like fluorescence components increased during the incubations. The amount of DOC degraded was not affected by the length of DOM predegradation. The percentage of bioavailable DOC (\%BDOC) was higher in experiment units with added inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus than without addition (on average 13.5 \% and 9.0, respectively), but had no effect on the degradation of fresh, non-predegraded, DOC (\%BDOC 12.0 \%). Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) was highest (65 {$\pm$} 2 \%) in the units with fresh DOM, and lowest in units with predegraded DOM and no added inorganic nutrients (11 {$\pm$} 4 \%). The addition of inorganic nutrients increased the BGE of predegraded DOM units by an average of 28 {$\pm$} 4 \%. There was no significant effect on BGE by length of predegradation after the initial drop ({$<$}3 months). This study suggests that both the length of predegradation and the inorganic nutrient status in the receiving estuary has consequences to carbon cycling and will determine the amount of terrestrial-derived DOC being ultimately assimilated into marine food webs. \textcopyright{} 2014 Springer Basel.},

Besides the bulk concentration parameters, a suite of DOM quality parameters were investigated, including colored DOM (CDOM), fluorescent DOM, and the molecular weight of DOM as well as associated dissolved iron concentrations. We observed significant deviations from conservative mixing at low salinities ({$<$}2) in the estuarine samples of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorption (a(CDOM254)), and humic-like fluorescence. The maximum deviation from conservative mixing for DOC concentration was -16\%, at salinities between 1 and 2. An associated laboratory experiment was conducted where an artificial salinity gradient between 0 and 6 was created. The experiment confirmed the findings from the estuarine transects, since part of the DOC and dissolved iron pools were transformed to particulate fraction ({$>$}0.2 \textmu m) and thereby removing them from the dissolved phase. We also measured flocculation of CDOM, especially in the UV region of the absorption spectrum. Protein-like fluorescence of DOM decreased, while humic-like fluorescence increased because of salt-induced flocculation. Additionally, there was a decrease in molecular weight of DOM. Consequently, the quantity and quality of the remaining DOM pool was significantly changed after influenced to flocculation. Based on these results, we constructed a mechanistic, two-component flocculation model. Our findings underline the importance of the coastal filter, where riverine organic matter is flocculated and exported to the sediments.},

These include transformations and degradation by biological and chemical processes, but also the production of fresh organic matter. Since many of these processes occur simultaneously, properties of the DOM pool represent the net changes during the passage along the hydrological path. We examined changes in multiple DOM characteristics across three Finnish estuarine gradients during spring, summer and autumn: Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, coloured DOM absorbance and fluorescence, stable carbon isotope signal of DOC and molecular size distribution. Changes in these DOM characteristics with salinity were analysed in relation to residence time (i.e. freshwater transit time), since increased residence time is likely to enhance DOM degradation while stimulating autochthonous DOM production at the same time. Our results show that the investigated DOM characteristics are highly correlated, indicating common physico-chemical transformations along the salinity continuum. Residence time did not explain variations in the DOM characteristics any better than salinity. Due to large variations in DOM characteristics at the river end-member, conservative mixing models do not seem to be able to accurately describe the occurrence and extent of deviations in DOM properties in the estuaries we investigated.},

The major driver of observed DOM dynamics was the seasonally variable inorganic nutrient status and characteristics of the initial bulk DOM, whereas the characteristics of the phytoplankton community seemed to have a minor role. Net accumulation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during the 18-days experiments was 3.4 and 9.2 \textmu mol l -1 d -1 in P-limited spring and N-limited autumn, respectively. Bacterial bioassays revealed that the phytoplankton-derived DOC had surprisingly low proportions of biologically labile DOC, 12.6\% (spring) and 17.5\% (autumn). The optical characteristics of the DOM changed throughout the experiments, demonstrating continuous heterotrophic processing of the DOM pool. However, these temporal changes in optical characteristics of the DOM pool were not the same between seasons, indicating seasonally variable environmental drivers. Nitrogen and phosphorus availability is likely the main driver of these seasonal differences, affecting both phytoplankton extracellular release of DOM and its heterotrophic degradation by bacteria. These findings underline the complexity of the DOM production and consumption by the natural planktonic community, and show the importance of the prevailing environmental conditions regulating the DOM pathways.},

These coastal zones are transitions between freshwater and marine systems where multiple biogeochemical processes remove, produce and transform organic matter. The extent to which the coastal zone is merely a conduit for terrestrial (allochthonous) organic matter, versus a distinct source of autochthonous organic matter fueled by eutrophication, is unclear. To address this issue, we characterized the freshwater and marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) pools in an eutrophic estuary with a long water residence time (Roskilde Fjord, Denmark) over an annual cycle. We combined elemental, optical (absorbance and fluorescence) and isotopic analyses to obtain insight about the bulk properties of the DOM pool during this period. We also used sediment traps to analyze the changes related to the exchange of organic matter between the particulate (POM) and dissolved (DOM) fractions. The results showed that labile autochthonous DOM from in situ primary production was rapidly transformed to more recalcitrant DOM that accumulated in the estuary despite continuous exchange with the open sea. Also, parts of the POM pool were degraded rapidly (within 24h) and transformed into the DOM pool. Accumulated DOM was characterized by relatively low molecular size and stable carbon isotopic value, and by high protein-like fluorescence. These results indicate that autotrophic material can be a major source of specific recalcitrant DOM in eutrophic coastal waters, contributing significantly to the flux of organic carbon to the ocean.},

  abstract = {The Arctic icescape is rapidly transforming from a thicker multiyear ice cover to a thinner and largely seasonal first-year ice cover with significant consequences for Arctic primary production. One critical challenge is to understand how productivity will change within the next decades. Recent studies have reported extensive phytoplankton blooms beneath ponded sea ice during summer, indicating that satellite-based Arctic annual primary production estimates may be significantly underestimated. Here we present a unique time-series of a phytoplankton spring bloom observed beneath snow-covered Arctic pack ice. The bloom, dominated by the haptophyte algae Phaeocystis pouchetii, caused near depletion of the surface nitrate inventory and a decline in dissolved inorganic carbon by 16 {$\pm$} 6 g C m -2 . Ocean circulation characteristics in the area indicated that the bloom developed in situ despite the snow-covered sea ice. Leads in the dynamic ice cover provided added sunlight necessary to initiate and sustain the bloom. Phytoplankton blooms beneath snow-covered ice might become more common and widespread in the future Arctic Ocean with frequent lead formation due to thinner and more dynamic sea ice despite projected increases in high-Arctic snowfall. This could alter productivity, marine food webs and carbon sequestration in the Arctic Ocean. Annual phytoplankton net primary production in the Arctic Ocean has increased by 30\% since the late 1990's mainly due to the declining sea ice extent and an increasing phytoplankton growth season},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations \textendash{} mainly of terrestrial origin \textendash{} are increasing worldwide in inland waters. Heterotrophic bacteria are the main consumers of DOC and thus determine DOC temporal dynamics and availability for higher trophic levels. Our aim was to study bacterial carbon (C) turnover with respect to DOC quantity and chemical quality using both allochthonous and autochthonous DOC sources. We incubated a natural bacterial community with allochthonous C (13C-labeled beech leachate) and increased concentrations and pulses (intermittent occurrence of organic matter input) of autochthonous C (phytoplankton lysate). We then determined bacterial C consumption, activities, and community composition together with the C flow through bacteria using stable C isotopes. The chemical analysis of single sources revealed differences in aromaticity and low- and high-molecular-weight substance fractions (LMWS and HMWS, respectively) between allochthonous and autochthonous C sources. Both DOC sources (allochthonous and autochthonous DOC) were metabolized at a high bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) around 50 \%. In treatments with mixed sources, rising concentrations of added autochthonous DOC resulted in a further, significant increase in bacterial DOC consumption of up to 68\% when nutrients were not limiting. This rise was accompanied by a decrease in the humic substance (HS) fraction and an increase in bacterial biomass. Changes in DOC concentration and consumption in mixed treatments did not affect bacterial community composition (BCC), but BCC differed in single vs. mixed incubations. Our study highlights that DOC quantity affects bacterial C consumption but not BCC in nutrient-rich aquatic systems. BCC shifted when a mixture of allochthonous and autochthonous C was provided simultaneously to the bacterial community. Our results indicate that chemical quality rather than source of DOC per se (allochthonous vs. autochthonous) determines bacterial DOC turnover.},

For comparison, we also collected data in the open ocean waters of North Atlantic. The exponential slope of the CDOM absorption spectrum varied within a narrow range around 0.0176 nm-1 (SD = 0.0020 nm-1). When data from all the regions were considered altogether, the relationship between phytoplankton absorption and chlorophyll concentration was generally similar to the one previously established for open oceanic waters. Our coastal data, however, show that significant departures from the general trend may occur due to peculiar pigment composition and cell size. In some coastal areas, high phaeopigment concentrations gave rise to especially high blue-to-red ratio of phytoplankton absorption. The NAP absorption covaried with the particle dry weight. Most absorption spectra of these particles were well described by an exponential function with a slope averaging 0.0123 nm-1 (SD = 0.0013 nm-1). In some highly turbid waters, the spectra exhibited a signature possibly associated with iron oxides. In the Baltic Sea, NAP absorption systematically showed lower values at wavelengths shorter than 440 nm than predicted from the fitted exponential function. Overall, the variability in the absorption properties of European coastal waters showed some consistent patterns despite the high diversity of the examined waters. Distinct features were identified in the phytoplankton and NAP components. An absorption budget is presented and parameterizations are proposed.},

Inorganic C-13 addition enriched algal carbon in C-13 and changed the delta C-13- DOC by + 1.5 parts per thousand to + 9.5 parts per thousand, depending on the specific lake. This change in delta C-13- DOC represented a significant input of algal DOC that was not completely consumed by bacteria. We modeled the dynamics in delta C-13- DOC to estimate the fluxes of algal and terrestrial carbon to and from the DOC pool, and determine the composition of the standing stock. Two experiments in lightly stained, oligotrophic lakes indicated that algal production was the source of about 20\% of the DOC pool. In the following year, the experiment was repeated in one of these lakes under conditions of nutrient enrichment, and in a third, more humic lake. Algal contributions to the DOC pool were 40\% in the nutrient enriched lake and 5\% in the more humic lake. Spectroscopic and elemental analyses corroborated the presence of increased algal DOC in the nutrient enriched lake. Natural abundance measurements of the delta C-13 of DOC in 32 lakes also revealed the dual contributions of both terrestrial and algal carbon to DOC. From these results, we suggest an approach for inferring the contribution of algal and terrestrial DOC using easily measurable parameters.},

Stephanodiscus hantzschii, Pseudanabaena limnetica, Planktothrix agardhii and Aulacoseira granulata var. angustissima were the most frequent species. In autumn, small centric diatoms dominated the whole river course. Irrespective of the season, in the fluvial lakes of the upper river, a substantial increase of phytoplankton biomass was observed. Shallow upstream river stretches were associated with large biomass losses. In the deep, slow flowing lower regions, total biomass remained constant. Longitudinal changes in biomass reflected downstream variations in flow velocity and river morphology. Cyanobacteria, cryptophytes and diatom species were subjected to large biomass losses along fast flowing, shallow river sections, whereas chlorophytes were favoured. Diatoms and cryptophytes benefited from low flow velocity and increased water depth in the downstream river. Changes in water depth and flow velocity have been found as key factors that cause the longitudinal differences in phytoplankton composition and biomass in small rivers.},

EEMs contain information which can be modeled using the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model but the data analysis is often complicated due to both Rayleigh and Raman scattering. There are several established ways to deal with scattering effects. However, all of these methods have associated problems. This paper develops a new method for handling scattering using interpolation in the areas affected by first- and second-order Rayleigh and Raman scatter in such a way that the interfering signal is, at best, removed. The suggested method is fast and requires no additional input other than specifying the scattering region. The results of the proposed method were compared with those obtained from common alternative approaches used for preprocessing fluorescence data before analysis with PARAFAC and were shown to be equally good for various types of EEM data. The main advantage of the interpolation method is in its lack of additional metaparameters, its algorithmic speed and subsequent speed-up of PARAFAC modeling. It also allows for using EEM data in software not able to handle missing data. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Upstream, downstream, and STW discharge samples for two STWs demonstrated that treated sewage has a distinct fluorescence EEM, with high tryptophan and fulvic-like fluorescence intensities that are of approximately equal ratio. This signature could be seen in downstream samples. When all 10 sample locations were compared, two trend lines were apparent where STW impacted rivers plotted separately from the other sample locations. Fluorescence EEM signatures were compared to absorption at 254 nm and demonstrated to provide a better fingerprint of sewage-impacted water. It is suggested that fluorescence EEM spectropho-tometry can provide a useful tool for the analysis of grab samples taken for both routine and investigative monitoring and has the potential for on-line monitoring of STW impacts on river systems.},

The catchment has three major tributaries: the North Tyne which has good water quality, high dissolved organic carbon concentrations and visible water colour from the high proportion of peat in its upper catchment; the South Tyne which has good water quality with typical riverine dissolved organic carbon concentrations and drains from limestone uplands; and the Derwent, a more urbanized catchment which is increasingly impacted by treated sewage effluent discharges towards its mouth. Thirty sample sites, 23 along the three main tributaries and seven within the estuary, were sampled on six occasions over the period 2002-2003. High absorbance at 340 nm and dissolved organic carbon concentration identify N Tyne waters due to the peaty headwaters, but no downstream trends in these parameters are observed in any of the tributaries, in contrast to the estuary where a rapid decrease is observed in both. Fluorescence in contrast demonstrated downstream trends in both intensity and wavelength, especially in the Derwent as it is increasingly impacted by anthropogenic dissolved organic matter. Elevated protein-like fluorescence intensity also fingerprints sewage effluent within the estuary. The absorbance coefficient at 340 nm was found to have the strongest correlation to dissolved organic carbon concentration, greater than all fluorescence intensity parameters measured. However, fluorescence analysis permits the source of the dissolved organic matter to be determined, and therefore has implications for understanding its fate in estuaries and the ocean. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Two fluorophores were compared in detail: tryptophan-like fluorescence, whose filtration and pH characteristics are relatively poorly understood, and humic-like fluorescence, which is better characterised. Although there was some variability in both fluorophores, the tryptophan-like fluorescence showed the most significant decrease in fluorescence intensity between raw and 1.2 ??m filter samples, and a much smaller decrease between 1.2 and 0.2 ??m, demonstrating a significant source associated with particulate material as well as a significant {$<$}0.2 ??m fraction. In contrast, humic-like fluorescence shows little change with filtration, suggesting that the majority of this fluorescence is associated with truly dissolved material. The pH perturbation experiments demonstrate that tryptophan-like fluorescence is less impacted by pH than with filter fraction. For humic-like fluorescence, pH effects are weak and are not as consistent as those reported in the literature for extracted humic substances. pH perturbation of the freshwaters shows a wide range of sample specific pH responses, significantly more variable than that observed in experiments using extracted humic substances and tryptophan standards, demonstrating the natural variability of freshwater dissolved organic matter. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyzed long term data from watersheds underlain with varying degrees of permafrost, sampled springs and thermokarsts, used fluorescence spectroscopy, and measured the bioavailabity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Permafrost driven patterns in hydrology and vegetation influenced DOM patterns in streams, with the stream draining the high permafrost watershed having higher DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations, higher DOC:DON and greater specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) than the streams draining the low and medium permafrost watersheds. Streams, springs and thermokarsts exhibited a wide range of DOC and DON concentrations (1.5-37.5 mgC/L and 0.14-1.26 mgN/L, respectively), DOC:DON (7.1-42.8) and SUVA (1.5-4.7 L mgC(-1) m(-1)). All sites had a high proportion of humic components, a low proportion of protein components, and a low fluorescence index value (1.3-1.4), generally consistent with terrestrially derived DOM. Principal component analysis revealed distinct groups in our fluorescence data determined by diagenetic processing and DOM source. The proportion of bioavailable DOC ranged from 2 to 35\%, with the proportion of tyrosine- and tryptophan-like fluorophores in the DOM being a major predictor of DOC loss (p {$<$} 0.05, R (2) = 0.99). Our results indicate that the degradation of permafrost in CPCRW will result in a decrease in DOC and DON concentrations, a decline in DOC:DON, and a reduction in SUVA, possibly accompanied by a change in the proportion of bioavailable DOC.},

  abstract = {Seventy-five diatom strains isolated from the Beaufort Sea (Canadian Arctic) in the summer of 2009 were characterized by light and electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), as well as 18S and 28S rRNA gene sequencing. These strains group into 20 genotypes and 17 morphotypes and are affiliated with the genera Arcocellulus, Attheya, Chaetoceros, Cylindrotheca, Eucampia, Nitzschia, Porosira, Pseudo-nitzschia, Shionodiscus, Thalassiosira, and Synedropsis. Most of the species have a distribution confined to the northern/polar area. Chaetoceros neogracilis and Chaetoceros gelidus were the most represented taxa. Strains of C. neogracilis were morphologically similar and shared identical 18S rRNA gene sequences, but belonged to four distinct genetic clades based on 28S rRNA, ITS-1 and ITS-2 phylogenies. Secondary structure prediction revealed that these four clades differ in hemi-compensatory base changes (HCBCs) in paired positions of the ITS-2, suggesting their inability to interbreed. Reproductively isolated C. neogracilis genotypes can thus co-occur in summer phytoplankton communities in the Beaufort Sea. C. neogracilis generally occurred as single cells but also formed short colonies. It is phylogenetically distinct from an Antarctic species, erroneously identified in some previous studies as C. neogracilis, but named here as Chaetoceros sp. This work provides taxonomically validated sequences for 20 Arctic diatom taxa, which will facilitate future metabarcoding studies on phytoplankton in this region.},

Water samples were collected in summer (July 1995) and winter (February 1996), and for the winter sample, DOM was separated into humic substances and 'non-humic' compounds by fractionation on an XAD-8 resin. Following exposure in quartz flasks to either natural or simulated sunlight, bacteria were found to utilize as much as 300\% more organic matter in irradiated whole DOM and chemical fractions compared to non-irradiated counterparts. Previous studies have shown that humic substances, which have strong absorption in the UV region of sunlight, are important sources of biologically labile photoproducts. We now demonstrate that compounds outside this operational definition are also sources for labile photoproducts, and that production rates on an absorbance-normalized basis can be equivalent for the humic and non-humic components of DOM. Humic substances were nonetheless calculated to be the primary source of bio logically labile photoproducts in these samples, based on the fact that they absorbed most ({$>$} 85 \%) of the sunlight. Exposure of DOM fractions to sunlight for the equivalent of 7 h of noontime sun (at 34 degrees N latitude) resulted in the bacterial utilization lover a subsequent 4 d period) of up to 6\% of the humic substances pool (compared to 1.5 \% for non-irradiated controls), and 11 \% of the non-humic compounds (compared to 3\% for non-irradiated controls).},

In the St. Lawrence ETZ, where zebra mussel veligers are now the dominant zooplankton in summer, delta C-13 ranged from -31.2 parts per thousand (seston) to - 16.1 parts per thousand (adult fish) and delta N-15 ranged from 2.6 parts per thousand to 17.4 parts per thousand. Isotopic analysis of samples indicated that the overall food web was largely supported by autochthonous phytoplankton rather than by allochthonous terrestrial carbon. Large differences among the isotopic signals of veligers, cladocerans, and copepods suggested the use of different proportions of food items, and the isotopic values of fish larvae indicated no significant assimilation of veligers. The delta C-13 signature of the veligers was in a range consistent with feeding on free-living bacteria and di! ssolved organic carbon (DOC) or both, and freshwater algae incubated in situ. To investigate the possibility of DOC uptake by the veligers, we incubated veligers on C-14-labelled algal lysates. There was rapid uptake of DOC and incorporation into biomass, equivalent to 6\% of the soft tissue dry weight per hour. Zebra mussel veligers are likely using autochthonous DOC as an alternate food source, and they occupy an exotic trophic position in which there is little direct interaction with other major components of the ETZ food web.

  abstract = {While empirical studies linking biodiversity to local environmental gradients have emphasized the importance of lake trophic status (related to primary productivity), theoretical studies have implicated resource spatial heterogeneity and resource relative ratios as mechanisms behind these biodiversity patterns. To test the feasibility of these mechanisms in natural aquatic systems, the biodiversity of crustacean zooplankton communities along gradients of total phosphorus (TP) as well as the vertical heterogeneity and relative abundance of their phytoplankton resources were assessed in 18 lakes in Quebec, Canada. Zooplankton community richness was regressed against TP, the spatial distribution of phytoplankton spectral groups, and the relative biomass of spectral groups. Since species richness does not adequately capture ecological function and life history of different taxa, features which Lire important for mechanistic theories, relationships between zooplankton functional diversity (FD) and resource conditions were examined. Zooplankton species richness showed the previously established tendency to a unimodal relationship with TP, but functional diversity declined linearly over the same gradient. Changes in zooplankton functional diversity could be attributed to changes in both the spatial distribution and type of phytoplankton resource. In the studied lakes, spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton groups declined with TP, even while biomass of all groups increased. Zooplankton functional diversity was positively related to increased heterogeneity in cyanobacteria spatial distribution. However, a smaller amount of variation in functional diversity was also positively related to the ratio of biomass in diatoms/chrysophytes to cyanobacteria. In all observed relationships, a greater variation of functional diversity than species richness measures was explained by measured factors, suggesting that functional measures of zooplankton communities will benefit ecological research attempting to identify mechanisms behind environmental gradients affecting diversity.},

Project work integrates across various disciplines that range from biogeochemistry, environmental engineering, computer modelling and chemistry to socio-economic sciences. Field study areas are the river basins of the Ebro, the Meuse, the Elbe and the Danube as well as the 3-km(2) French catchment of the Brevilles Spring. Within the first 2 years of the project more than 1700 samples of atmospherically deposited particles, sediments, and water have been collected in the above-mentioned systems. Results show clear spatial patterns of deposition of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with the highest rates in the Meuse Basin. For local inputs, in the Brevilles sandy aquifer, the contamination of the groundwater by the pesticides atrazine (AT) and deethylatrazine did not decrease even 5 years after their agricultural inputs were stopped. On the other hand, herbicides such as mecroprop (MCPP), and PAHs, were at least partially degraded microbiologically in laboratory studies with soils and aquifer material from selected sites. For sediment transport of contaminants, new flood sampling techniques revealed highest deposition rates of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) in river sediments at hotspot areas on the Mulde River in the Bitterfeld region (Elbe Basin, Germany). These selected preliminary results of AquaTerra help to improve fundamental understanding of persistent organic pollutants (POP) in the environment. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Thereafter, in the reach upstream from Montreal, Chi a was -1 mu g.L-1 and total phosphorus (TP) was -10 mu g.L-1. Downstream from Montreal, TP increased to 20-40 mu g.L-1 and Chl a rose to 2-5 mu g.L-1. Although Chi a increased concomitant with TP, phytoplankton may have been light limited at the more turbid downstream stations. Zooplankton biomass decreased from 40 mu g dry mass.L-1 in Lake Ontario to 16 mu g dry mass.L-1 at Brockville, 90 km downstream. Zooplankton biomass continued to decline and downstream from Montreal remained {$<$}10 mu g dry mass.L-1, despite the increased TP and Chl a. Rotifers dominated the zooplankton community, but as in other temperate rivers, total zooplankton biomass was low ({$<$}10 mu g dry mass.L-1).

To determine the influence of macrophyte beds on plankton abundance within fluvial lakes of the St Lawrence River, planktonic components (macrozooplankton, heterotrophic bacteria, and phytoplankton as chlorophyll-a [Chl-a]) were sampled in Lake St Francis and Lake St Pierre during summer 1998. We tested the hypothesis that the abundance of planktonic components was higher within macrophyte beds in comparison to the more rapidly flushed open water areas of the fluvial lakes. 2. The large cross channel variation in zooplankton biomass was indeed correlated with the presence of dense beds of submerged macrophytes. Total macrozooplankton biomass was nine-fold greater within the beds (mean = 180 mug L(-1) dry mass) than in either the open water or areas with only sparse vegetation (mean = 20 mug L(-1) dry mass). 3. Chl-a and heterotrophic bacterial abundance were also higher in the beds, but only slightly so. There was no difference in total phosphorus or dissolved organic carbon concentrations between areas of dense vegetation, sparse vegetation or open water. 4. Macrophyte beds on the margins of the fluvial lakes allow the development of high planktonic abundance relative to the fast flowing central channel. Macrozooplankton biomass was much higher at the outflows of the lakes (similar to 50 mug L(-1) dry mass) in comparison to the inflows ({$<$}20 {$<$}mu{$>$}g L(-1) dry mass). The increase is due to the transfer of organisms from submerged macrophyte beds into the central channel in the downstream quarter of the two lakes where the marginal littoral waters enter central channel waters. 5. Along rivers, shallow fluvial lakes appear to act as sources of plankton which is exported downstream during years of extensive littoral macrophyte development.},

We monitored the development and activity of biofilms in streamside flumes operated under two flow regimes (slow [0.065 m s(-1)] and fast [0.23 m s(-1)]) by combined confocal laser scanning microscopy with cryosectioning to observe biofilm structure and composition. Biofilm growth started as bacterial microcolonies embedded in extracellular polymeric substances and transformed into ripple-like structures and ultimately conspicuous quasihexagonal networks. These structures were particularly pronounced in biofilms grown under slow current velocities and were characterized by the prominence of pennate diatoms oriented along their long axes to form the hexagons. Microstructural heterogeneity was dynamic, and biofilms that developed under slower velocities were thicker and had larger surface sinuosity and higher areal densities than their counterparts exposed to higher velocities. Surface sinuosity and biofilm fragmentation increased with thickness, and these changes likely reduced resistance to the mass transfer of solutes from the water column into the biofilms. Nevertheless, estimates of dissolved organic carbon uptake and microbial growth suggested that internal cycling of carbon was more important in thick biofilms grown in slow flow conditions. High-pressure liquid chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection analyses of exopolysaccharides documented a temporal shift in monosaccharide composition as the glucose levels decreased and the levels of rhamnose, galactose, mannose, xylose, and arabinose increased. We attribute this change in chemical composition to the accumulation of diatoms and increased incorporation of detrital particles in mature biofilms.},

Here, we combine recent findings from geophysics, microbial ecology and organic geochemistry to show geophysical opportunity and microbial capacity to enhance the net heterotrophy in streams, rivers and estuaries. We identify hydrological storage and retention zones that extend the residence time of organic carbon during downstream transport as geophysical opportunities for microorganisms to develop as attached biofilms or suspended aggregates, and to metabolize organic carbon for energy and growth. We consider fluvial networks as meta-ecosystems to include the acclimation of microbial communities in downstream ecosystems that enable them to exploit energy that escapes from upstream ecosystems, thereby increasing the overall energy utilization at the network level. \textcopyright{} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter describes the carbon isotopic composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The sources, turnover, and fates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the oceans have been studied by a number of techniques and approaches using both direct measurements and inferred assessments and modeling. Foremost among the direct measurement techniques is the use of molecular ``fingerprinting'' or organic biomarker compound analyses and natural carbon isotopic measurements. Each of these approaches has specific advantages and disadvantages for its application to studies of \{DOC\} biogeochemistry and yields unique information about the distributions and cycling of both ``bulk'' (total) \{DOC\} and its constituent organic fractions. Organic biomarkers can be highly sensitive with respect to identifying the contributions of both general sources (e.g., marine vs terrestrial organic matter) as well as specific organisms (different genera and species of primary and secondary producers) to various organic carbon pools, including DOC. However, organic compounds may undergo structural modification because of bacterial and photochemical degradation and as a result can rapidly lose their structural specificity. In addition, ``identifiable'' biomarker compound classes and specific compounds typically represent only a small proportion (generally not more than 20\textendash 25\%) of the total \{DOC\} pool and as such may or may not be representative of the cycling of the ``average'' bulk or total pool.},

State-of-the-art process-oriented biosphere models used for climate predictions exhibit a large between-model variation of GPP's latitudinal patterns and show higher spatial correlations between GPP and precipitation, suggesting the existence of missing processes or feedback mechanisms which attenuate the vegetation response to climate. Our estimates of spatially distributed GPP and its covariation with climate can help improve coupled climate-carbon cycle process models.},

  abstract = {Availability of remotely sensed phytoplankton biomass fields has greatly advanced pri- mary production modeling efforts. However, conversion of near-surface chlorophyll concentrations to carbon fixation rates has been hindered by uncertainties in modeling light-saturated photosynthesis (Pb max). Here, we introduce a physiologically-based model for Pb max that focuses on the effects of photoacclimation and nutrient limitation on relative changes in cellular chlorophyll and CO2 fixation capacities. This `PhotoAcc' model describes Pb max as a function of light level at the bottom of the mixed layer or at the depth of interest below the mixed layer. Nutrient status is assessed from the relationship between mixed layer and nutricline depths. Temperature is assumed to have no direct influence on Pb max above 5\textdegree C. The PhotoAcc model was parameterized using photosynthesis- irradiance observations made from extended transects across the Atlantic Ocean. Model perfor- mance was validated independently using time-series observations from the Sargasso Sea. The PhotoAcc model accounted for 70 to 80\% of the variance in light-saturated photosynthesis. Previously described temperature-dependent models did not account for a significant fraction of the variance in Pb max for our test data sets.},

Determinations of NPP are necessarily a function of phytoplankton biomass and its physiological status, but the estimation of these two terms from space has remained an elusive target. Here we present new satellite ocean color observations of phytoplankton carbon (C) and chlorophyll (Chl) biomass and show that derived Chl:C ratios closely follow anticipated physiological dependencies on light, nutrients, and temperature. With this new information, global estimates of phytoplankton growth rates ({$\mu$}) and carbon-based NPP are made for the first time. Compared to an earlier chlorophyll-based approach, our carbon-based values are considerably higher in tropical oceans, show greater seasonality at middle and high latitudes, and illustrate important differences in the formation and demise of regional algal blooms. This fusion of emerging concepts from the phycological and remote sensing disciplines has the potential to fundamentally change how we model and observe carbon cycling in the global oceans.

We examine the variation in structure attributable to local environmental (i.e., lake chemical and physical variables) vs. dispersal predictors ( i.e., overland and watercourse distances between lakes) using variation partitioning techniques.

Statistical correlations and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) identified turbidity as an important environmental parameter affecting ecological processes on coral reefs, as reflected by changes in the composition and abundance of reef fishes and benthic communities. Lower fish density and species richness was found at turbid sites. Turbidity was also negatively correlated to percent coral cover, which together with rugosity, were additional habitat parameters shaping reef fish assemblages. Bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum and yellowtail damselfish Microspathodon chrysurus were species rarely present at turbid sites and abundant at clear ones. The yellowtail hamlet Hypoplectrus chlorurus and sharknose goby Elacatinus evelynae had the opposite distribution along the turbidity gradient. We identified seawater turbidity as an additional predictor of the reef fish community structure in La Parguera, in addition to live coral cover and reef rugosity. Because coral reefs and reef fishes were less complex (lower rugosity, less species richness, less diversity) in more turbid sites, managing for clear water conditions within the coastal area of La Parguera should lead to improved ecosystem resilience and stability, and should become a primary goal of management.},

  abstract = {Photomineralization of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (tDOM) in the Arctic Ocean is limited by persistent sea ice cover that reduces the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the underlying water column. UV-dependent processes are likely to accelerate as a result of shrinking sea ice extent and decreasing ice thickness caused by climatic warming over this region. In this study, we made the first quantitative estimates of photomineralization of tDOM in a coastal Arctic ecosystem under current and future sea ice regimes. We used an optical-photochemical coupled model incorporating water column optics and experimental measurements of photoproduction of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), the main carbon product of DOM photochemistry. Apparent quantum yields of DIC photoproduction were determined on water samples from the Mackenzie River estuary, the Mackenzie Shelf, and Amundsen Gulf. UV irradiances just below the sea surface were estimated by combining satellite backscattered and passive microwave radiance measurements with a radiative transfer model. The mean annual DIC photoproduction between 1979 and 2003 was estimated as 66.5 +/- 18.5 Gg carbon in the surface waters of the southeastern Beaufort Sea, where UV absorption is dominated by chromophoric dissolved organic matter discharged by the Mackenzie River. This value is equivalent to 10\% of bacterial respiration rates, 8\% of new primary production rates and 2.8 +/- 0.6\% of the 1.3 Tg of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) discharged annually by the Mackenzie River into the area. During periods of reduced ice cover such as 1998, the latter value could rise to 5.1\% of the annual riverine DOC discharge. Under an ice-free scenario, the model predicted that 150.5 Gg of DIC would be photochemically produced, mineralizing 6.2\% of the DOC input from the Mackenzie River. These results show that the predicted trend of ongoing contraction of sea ice cover will greatly accelerate the photomineralization of tDOM in Arctic surface waters.},

Ice melting in the Arctic Ocean exposes the surface water to more radiative energy with poorly understood effects on photo-biogeochemical processes and heat deposition in the upper ocean. In August 2009, we documented the vertical variability of light absorbing components at 37 stations located in the southeastern Beaufort Sea including both Mackenzie River-influenced waters and polar mixed layer waters. We found that melting multiyear ice released significant amount of non-algal particulates (NAP) near the sea surface relative to subsurface waters. NAP absorption coefficients at 440 nm (aNAP(440)) immediately below the sea surface were on average 3-fold (up to 10-fold) higher compared to subsurface values measured at 2\textendash 3 m depth. The impact of this unusual feature on the light transmission and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) was further examined using a radiative transfer model. A 10-fold particle enrichment homogeneously distributed in the first meter of the water column slightly reduced photosynthetically available and usable radiation (PAR and PUR) by \&sim;6 and \&sim;8\%, respectively, relative to a fully homogenous water column with low particle concentration. In terms of Rrs, the particle enrichment significantly flattered the spectrum by reducing the Rrs by up to 20\% in the blue-green spectral region (400\textendash 550 nm). These results highlight the impact of meltwater on the concentration of particles at sea surface, and the need for considering non-uniform vertical distribution of particles in such systems when interpreting remotely sensed ocean color. Spectral slope of aNAP spectra calculated in the UV (ultraviolet) domain decreased with depth suggesting that this parameter is sensitive to detritus composition and/or diagenesis state (e.g., POM (particulate organic matter) photobleaching).},

Two analytical models were tested to predict the shading error using measured inherent optical properties, the sun zenith angle, and the fraction of diffuse sky irradiance. Neglecting light scattering led to overestimates of the shading error. In contrast, the bias was removed when the scattering coefficient was accounted for, but the overall error was only barely improved (root-mean-square error ).

In all years, virtual larvae were released nearshore in southwestern Lake Michigan, a known and important spawning region for yellow perch. For any given Year, the same circulation pattern and water temperature either promoted or reduced yellow perch settlement depending on the consumption rates and settlement size chosen in the growth model. Increased consumption increased the number of settled larvae and expanded the total area where larvae settled, whereas increased settlement Size reduced the number of settled larvae and reduced the overall settlement area. Interannual variability in circulation patterns and water temperature also resulted in contrasting larval settlement rates, settlement locations, and size of settlement areas between years. Model predictions were most consistent with field observations of age-0 yellow perch from Illinois and Michigan waters when settlement was assumed to occur at 50 mm. Moreover, our model suggests that larvae originating from southwestern Lake Michigan can recruit anywhere within the southern basin and even in the northern basin. Future model improvement will require information on the relative contribution of various sectors to the larval pool, their distribution with reference to the hydrodynamic landscape, the feeding and growth of yellow perch during their pelagic phase, and the size at transition to demersal stage.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the interaction and small-scale processes occurring around the inlets that connect the Venice Lagoon with the Northern Adriatic Sea. In a previous paper, barotropic processes have been investigated, whereas here, the focus is on the baroclinic processes. The hydrodynamics of the area are studied by means of a 3D shallow water hydrodynamic finite-element model, suitable to describe areas of complex morphology such as the coasts and the interaction channels. This is the first work that models the 3D interaction between the Venice Lagoon and the Adriatic Sea. Three different sets of simulations have been carried out to identify the physics behind the small-scale processes and the influence of the main forcings on the study area. The first imposes different idealized forcings, such as tides, wind, and river runoff. The vorticity maps of the first two layers show the predominance of wind forcing in the coastal area and tidal forcing in the three inlets of the Lagoon. Bora wind acts homogeneously, increasing the littoral currents, while Sirocco wind mainly impacts near Chioggia inlet, with a coastal current reversal, inducing its detachment offshore. Freshwater patterns are present along the coast, near the river mouths. Rivers do not directly influence the circulation close to the coast in front of the Venice Lagoon, except for the area near Chioggia inlet, where the Brenta river action can be seen. The second set of simulations deals with a sensitivity analysis to define the importance of the advection and of the baroclinic pressure gradient terms in the creation of persistent structures, such as small-scale coastal vortices seen along the littoral very close to the inlets. This analysis shows how advection is the main physical process responsible for the persistence of the positive vorticity structures close to the coast between the inlets, while the negative vorticity structures, also seen by the HF Radar, are due to the baroclinic-advective interaction. Finally, a real case, year 2004, has been simulated both to validate the model with observations and to identify the occurrence during the year of the characteristic hydrodynamic features attributable to the main forcings. The action of Bora wind characterizes the surface current patterns of February and November 2004, while Sirocco influences the month of May 2004. During periods of weak wind, the model reproduces the small-scale vortical structures close to the littoral.},

Available : Laodong Retrieved : 15 Abstract Cross - flow ultrafiltration (CFF) is often used to obtain separation and concentration of colloids from bulk natural water samples . Application of the ultrafiltration permeation model allows the quantitative determination of the low molecular weight material (LMW , b1 kDa) and colloids in bulk dissolved organic matter (DOM) from measurements of time series permeate samples obtained from CFF . Detailed analysis of a Yukon River water sample shows that DOM absorption coefficient and fluorescence follow the permeation model and that the complex spectral optical properties of LMW DOM can be reconstructed from CFF data . A combination of measured and modeled data indicates that the LMW contribution to bulk DOM optical properties obtained from CFF can be grossly underestimated by the use of a low concentration factor (CF , the ratio of initial sample volume to retentate volume) . Even at a relatively high CF of 19 , optical properties of LMW DOM calculated from measurements of the retentate or integrated permeate would underestimate true values by 5 \textendash{} 36\% . In the Yukon River sample , LMW dissolved organic carbon represented 26\% of the bulk concentration , but only 3 \textendash{} 14\% of the colored DOM was in the LMW fraction while 31 \textendash{} 33\% of bulk DOM florescence was due to LMW DOM . The contrasting optical properties of LMW and colloidal DOM support the concept that analysis of bulk DOM absorption and fluorescence properties reveals information about DOM molecular weight .},

Here, we test the effect of one classical trade-off - a negative correlation between seed size and seed number - by establishing microcosm plant communities with positive, negative and no correlation between seed size and seed number and analysing the effect of the seed size/number correlation on species richness. Consistent with theory, a negative correlation between seed size and seed number led to a higher number of species in the communities and a corresponding wider range of seed size (a measure of functional richness) by promoting coexistence of large- and small-seeded species. Our study provides the first direct evidence that a seed size/number trade-off may contribute to species coexistence, and at a wider context, demonstrates the potential role of functional trade-offs in maintaining species diversity.},

Numerous photoproducts of DOM, including dissolved inorganic carbon and low-molecular-weight organic compounds, have been identified, and the types of photoproducts and extent of phototransformation of DOM is dependent upon its chemical composition. Heterotrophic bacteria are the primary consumers of DOM, and photochemical transformations of DOM can affect its bacterial utilization in a variety of ways. Numerous studies spanning fresh and marine waters have demonstrated enhanced bacterial growth following exposure of DOM to solar radiation. These studies indicate that photochemical processes can enhance the microbial utilization of biorefractory DOM. Other studies in fresh and marine waters, however, have demonstrated that exposure of DOM to solar radiation can result in a reduction in bacterial growth rates, suggesting that photochemical and microbial processes "compete" for the same substrates. It appears that some photoproducts of DOM are resistant to microbial degradation, suggesting that photochemical processes could be involved in the production as well as destruction of biorefractory DOM.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary Oceans are the largest reservoirs of reactive organic carbon on the Earth. Most (97\%) of the organic carbon in seawater resides in the operationally defined dissolved phase. The separation of the particulate and dissolved phases is most commonly accomplished by the passage of water samples through filters with pore sizes in the range 0.2\textendash 1.0 {$\mu$}m. During the past decade, it has become increasingly common to avoid the filtration of open ocean water samples for the separation of the particulate and dissolved phases. Filtration is often omitted because particulate organic carbon (POC) is a small fraction of the total organic carbon and the extra handling and processing of water samples during filtration aboard ship can lead to contamination. Concentrations of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in unfiltered water samples are referred to as total organic concentrations (TOC, TON, and \{TOP\} respectively). Relatively small volumes (milliliters) of seawater are analyzed for these measurements and larger particles are not represented in these samples. Thus, the term ``total'' is somewhat of a misnomer for these analyses. In this chapter the data gathered on the concentrations and chemical composition of marine \{DOM\} includes some samples that were not filtered prior to the analysis. These samples come from the open ocean and the contribution of particulate organic matter (POM) to the reported data is considered to be minimal. In some cases, data for both filtered and unfiltered samples were available and the differences among these samples were often within the error of the measurement.},

Most of this carbon resides in dissolved molecules of varying bioavailability and reactivity, and aspects of the cycling of this carbon remain an enigma. The size-reactivity continuum model provides a conceptual framework for understanding the mechanisms governing the formation and mineralization of this carbon. In the seawater bioassay experiments that served as the original basis for this model, investigators observed that larger size classes of organic matter were more bioavailable and more rapidly remineralized by microbes than were smaller size classes. Studies of the chemical composition and radiocarbon content of marine organic matter have further indicated that the complexity and age of organic matter increase with decreasing molecular size. Biodegra-dation processes appear to shape the size distribution of organic matter and the nature of the small dissolved molecules that persist in the ocean.},

The degree to which allochthonous substrates support growth of bacteria is largely dependent on bacterial growth efficiency (BGE), i.e., bacterial production ( BP) per unit of assimilated carbon. Here we show how the spatial variability of BGE in the boreal region can be mediated by the distribution of the two dominating landscape elements forest and mires. Using an 11 days bioassay approach, the production and respiration of bacteria were measured in water samples from nine small Swedish streams (64 degrees N 19 degrees E), representing a gradient ranging from organic carbon supplied mainly from peat mires to carbon supplied mainly from coniferous forests. BP was positively correlated to forest coverage (\%) of the catchment, while bacterial respiration was similar in all streams. Consequently, BGE showed a strong positive correlation with forest coverage. Partial least square regression showed that BGE was chiefly regulated by qualitative properties of the organic material, indicated by the absorbance ratio a254/a365 plus C/N and C/P ratios. The data suggest that a share of the organic carbon pool, drained mainly from forest soils, had a potential of being incorporated into bacterial biomass with great efficiency. Its potential for supporting growth was probably nutrient regulated as indicated by inorganic nutrient enrichment experiments.},

Temporal variations in the terrigenous organic carbon support for aquatic bacteria are not well understood.

Using a 13-day bioassay approach, the production and respiration of bacteria were measured in water samples from six small Swedish streams (64 degrees N, 19 degrees E), draining coniferous forests, peat mires, and mixed catchments with typical boreal proportions between forest and mire coverage. Forest drainage supported higher bacterial production and higher bacterial growth efficiency than drainage from mires. The areal export of organic carbon was several times higher from mire than from forest at low runoff, while there was no difference at high flow. As a consequence, mixed streams (catchments including both mire and forest) were dominated by mire organic carbon with low support of bacterial production at low discharge situations but dominated by forest carbon supporting higher bacterial production at high flow. The stimulation of bacterial growth during high-flow episodes was a result of higher relative export of organic carbon via forest drainage rather than increased drainage of specific "high-quality" carbon pools in mire or forest soils.},

Previous studies have shown that these low-molecular-weight (LMW) substrates are released by phytoplankton but also that unidentified LMW compounds of terrestrial origin is a subsidy for bacterial metabolism in unproductive freshwater systems. We tested the hypothesis that different terrestrially derived CA, AA and CH compounds can offer substantial support for aquatic bacterial metabolism in fresh waters that are dominated by allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM). Drainage water from three catchments of different characters in the Krycklan experimental area in Northern Sweden were studied at the rising and falling limb of the spring flood, using a 2-week bioassay approach. A variety of CA, AA and CH compounds were significantly assimilated by bacteria, meeting 15-100\% of the bacterial carbon demand and explaining most of the observed variation in bacterial growth efficiency (BGE; R-2 = 0.66). Of the 29 chemical species that was detected, acetate was the most important, representing 45\% of the total bacterial consumption of all LMW compounds. We suggest that LMW organic compounds in boreal spring flood drainage could potentially support all in situ bacterial production in receiving lake waters during periods of weeks to months after the spring flood.

Given the large variability in water chemistry of the studied systems, we suggest that these photoproducts are universally produced in sunlight exposed lake water. The measured production of carboxylic acid carbon corresponded to 34.4\% (median) of the produced DIC. The production of DIC and carboxylic acids during 8 h of mild UV irradiation corresponded to an average of 4.7\% (SD 2.9) of the total dissolved organic carbon pool. Hence, photochemical degradation could be a major sink for DOM in the surface layer of lakes. All photoreaction rates were strongly correlated to the total radiation absorbed during UV exposure (r(2) {$>$} 0.8), which depends mainly on amount of colored DOM in the water. The variability in DIC production after normalizing for absorbed radiation energy could partly be attributed to general water chemistry parameters (e.g., pH, iron concentration, conductivity).},

Despite some evidence of within-population phenotypic variation in thermal behaviour, the occurrence of alternative tactics of this behaviour is rarely explicitly considered when studying natural populations. The main objective of this study was to determine whether different thermal tactics exist among individuals of the same population. We studied the behavioural thermoregulation of 33 adult brook charr in a stratified lake using thermo-sensitive radio transmitters that measured hourly individual temperature over one month. The observed behavioural thermoregulatory patterns were consistent between years and suggest the existence of four tactics: two "warm" tactics with both crepuscular and finer periodicities, with or without a diel periodicity, and two "cool" tactics, with or without a diel periodicity. Telemetry data support the above findings by showing that the different tactics are associated with different patterns of diel horizontal movements. Taken together, our results show a clear spatio-temporal segregation of individuals displaying different tactics, suggesting a reduction of niche overlap. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the presence of behavioural thermoregulatory tactics in a vertebrate.},

  abstract = {Larval dispersal is a crucial factor for fish recruitment. For fishes with relatively small-bodied larvae, drift has the potential to play a more important role than active habitat selection in determining larval dispersal; therefore, we expect small-bodied fish larvae to be poorly associated with habitat characteristics. To test this hypothesis, we used as model yellow perch (Perca flavescens), whose larvae are among the smallest among freshwater temperate fishes. Thus, we analysed the habitat association of yellow perch larvae at multiple spatial scales in a large shallow fluvial lake by explicitly modelling directional (e.g. due to water currents) and non-directional (e.g. due to aggregation) spatial patterns. This allowed us to indirectly assess the relative roles of drift (directional process) and potential habitat choice on larval dispersal. Our results give weak support to the drift hypothesis, whereas yellow perch show a strong habitat association at unexpectedly small sizes, when compared to other systems. We found consistent non-directional patterns in larvae distributions at both broad and medium spatial scales but only few significant directional components. The environmental variables alone (e.g. vegetation) generally explained a significant and biologically relevant fraction of the variation in fish larvae distribution data. These results suggest that (i) drift plays a minor role in this shallow system, (ii) larvae display spatial patterns that only partially covary with environmental variables, and (iii) larvae are associated to specific habitats. By suggesting that habitat association potentially includes an active choice component for yellow perch larvae, our results shed new light on the ecology of freshwater fish larvae and should help in building more realistic recruitment models.},

The Raman scattering source coefficient is the fractional gain in the scaler irradiance from local Raman scattering at a given depth, and it can be found from the Gershun equation with a Raman source term. In particular, by using calculations from a radiative transfer model (Hydrolight 3.0), we compare {$<$}(mu)over bar{$>$}, K, and P* from simulations that include and that omit Raman scattering. These simulations are performed at wavelengths between 355 and 665 nm in a vertically homogeneous ocean with inherent optical properties (IOPs) determined from case 1 bio-optical models for three different chlorophyll concentrations (0.05, 0.5, and 5 mg m(-3)). We also investigated several two-layered oceans that assumed different inherent optical properties in the surface and deep layers. Our calculations showed that when Raman scattering is present, there may exist strong vertical gradients in the average cosine and the diffuse attenuation coefficient, especially at long wavelengths for low chlorophyll concentrations. In addition, a quasi-asymptotic field may be a feature of the vertical profiles of the average cosine and the diffuse attenuation coefficient. In the asymptotic field, there is no effect of Raman scattering at shorter wavelengths, there is a strong effect of Raman scattering at longer wavelengths and between these two spectral regions, and there is a transition that increases from 500 to 590 nm as the concentration of chlorophyll increases from 0.05 to 5 mg m(-3). Over a broad range of IOPs, the asymptotic parameters {$<$}(mu)over bar{$>$}(infinity)*, K-infinity*, and P*(infinity) are related by a quadratic relationship. Neither the magnitude or angular distribution of surface light nor changes in the absorption and scattering coefficients in the surface layer of a two-layered ocean have any effect on the values of {$<$}(mu)over bar{$>$}(infinity)*, K-infinity*, and P*(infinity),; the values of these parameters depend only upon the IOPs in the deepest layer.},

Lignin-phenols, bulk stable carbon isotopes, compound-specific isotope analyses (CSIA) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry were used to examine the composition of high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMW DOM) at one station in the lower river over 6 different flow regimes in 1998 and 1999. It was estimated that the annual input of DOC delivered to the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River was of 3.1 X 10(-3) Pg, which represents 1.2\% of the total global input of DOC from rivers to the ocean. Average DOC and HMW DOC were 489 +/- 163 and 115 +/- 47 muM, respectively. C-13-NMR spectra revealed considerably more aliphatic structures than aromatic carbons in HMW DOC. Lignin phenols were significantly C-13-depleted with respect to bulk HMW DOM indicating that C-4 grass inputs to the HMW DOM were not significant. It is speculated that C-4 organic matter in the river is not being converted (via microbial decay) to HMW DOM as readily as C-3 organic matter is, because of the association of C-4 organic matter with finer sediments. The predominantly aliphatic C-13 NMR signature of HMW DOM suggests that autochthonous production in the river may be more important as a source of DOC than previously thought. Increases in nutrient loading and decreases in the suspended load (because of dams) in the Mississippi River, as well as other large rivers around the world, has resulted in significant changes in the sources and overall cycling of riverine DOC.

  abstract = {Seagrasses are typically light limited in many turbid estuarine systems. Light attenuation is due to water and three optically active constituents (OACs): nonalgal particulates, phytoplankton, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Using radiative transfer modeling, the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of these three OACs were linked to the light attenuation coefficient, K(PAR), which was measured in North River, North Carolina, by profiles of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Seagrasses in the southern portion of Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES), the second largest estuary in the USA, were found to be light limited at depths ranging from 0.87 to 2 m. This corresponds to a range of K(PAR) from 0.54 to 2.76 m(-1) measured during a 24-month monitoring program. Turbidity ranged from 2.20 to 35.55 NTU, chlorophyll a from 1.56 to 15.35 mg m(-3), and CDOM absorption at 440 nm from 0.319 to 3.554 m(-1). The IOP and water quality data were used to calibrate an existing bio-optical model, which predicted a maximum depth for seagrasses of 1.7 m using annual mean water quality values and a minimum light requirement of 22\% surface PAR. The utility of this modeling approach for the management of seagrasses in the APES lies in the identification of which water quality component is most important in driving light attenuation and limiting seagrass depth distribution. The calibrated bio-optical model now enables researchers and managers alike to set water quality targets to achieve desired water column light requirement goals that can be used to set criteria for seagrass habitat protection in North Carolina.},

However, the exact causes of biomass losses are still poorly understood and discharge measures of disturbance often only explain limited variance in periphyton development. We investigated the effects of 2 of the main mechanisms of flood disturbance to periphyton\textendash frequency of high-velocity events and frequency of bed sediment movement\textendash in an effort to better understand disturbance processes and improve the quantification of flood disturbance regimes for studies of stream periphyton. Three sites were selected in headwater streams in each of 4 groups according to a 2-way factorial design of frequency of high-velocity events and sediment stability, giving a total of 12 sites. Periphyton were sampled monthly for 15 mo and analyzed for chlorophyll a. Maximum photosynthetic rates (Pmax), chlorophyll-specific Pmax, community respiration (CR), and Pmax:CR ratios were determined seasonally. Nutrient concentrations were generally low and did not vary as a function of disturbance regime. Peaks in chlorophyll a were usually low reflecting the low nutrients. Chlorophyll was 2-10\texttimes{} higher where bed sediments moved 2 = 0.88). Chlorophyll a and water temperature were major correlates of Pmax, specific Pmax, and CR, and thus the metabolic variables partly reflected changes in biomass among the disturbance regimes. With chlorophyll and temperature removed as covariates, the main factor influencing all metabolic parameters was season. Pmax was 7\texttimes{} higher in summer than in spring when minima occurred, chlorophyll-specific Pmax was 10\texttimes{} higher in summer than in spring, and CR was 4\texttimes{} higher in autumn than in spring. Pmax:CR ratios indicated that the communities were generally autotrophic at times of maximum photosynthesis with the highest ratios in summer (3\texttimes{} higher than winter). The frequency of velocity perturbations also had a significant effect on Pmax:CR ratios with highest ratios at sites where there was a low frequency of high-velocity events. Our results suggest that sediment instability greatly increases disturbance intensity for periphyton. It is therefore essential to assess not just the frequency of floods, but also the degree of bed movement when quantifying disturbance regimes for periphyton in headwater streams.},

  abstract = {Tidal Spartina-dominated saltmarshes and estuaries on the Southeast US coast are global hotspots of productivity. In coastal Georgia, tidal amplitudes and saltmarsh productivity are the highest along the Southeast US coast. Coastal Georgia is characterized by a humid subtropical seasonal climate, and inter-annual variability in precipitation, and freshwater discharge. The 2012\textendash 2013 timeframe encompassed contrasting levels of discharge for the Savannah River, a major Georgia river, with a 4.3-fold greater discharge in summer 2013 relative to summer 2012. In situ measurements of temperature, salinity, precipitation and Secchi depth, and water samples were collected weekly at high tide throughout 2012 and 2013 from the Skidaway River Estuary, a tidal saltmarsh-dominated estuary in coastal Georgia influenced by Savannah River hydrology. The effects of elevated discharge on the seasonal trends of water column components were evaluated. The shift from low discharge (2012) to high discharge (2013) led to decreased salinity in summer 2013, but no significant increases in inorganic nutrient (NH4, NOx, SiO2 and PO4) concentrations. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations decreased, and DIC stable isotopic signatures ({$\delta$}13C-DIC values) were depleted in summer 2013 relative to summer 2012. In 2013 dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM: CDOM, FDOM) intensities, specific UV-absorbance (SUVA254) and relative humic-like fluorescence were all higher than in 2012, indicating that, as discharge increased in 2013, estuarine water became enriched in terrigenous DOM. Secchi depth and particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) concentrations displayed clear seasonal patterns that were not significantly altered by discharge. However, {$\delta$}13C-POC and {$\delta$}15N-PON isotopic signatures indicated higher terrigenous contributions at elevated discharge. Discharge influenced cyanobacterial composition, but did not affect total abundance of phytoplankton ({$<$}52 {$\mu$}m) or chlorophyll-a concentrations, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Phytoplankton community dynamics were primarily seasonally-driven. Bacterioplankton abundance and community composition, based upon flow cytometry, were affected by discharge, possibly due to decreased salinity and/or increased inputs of terrigenous DOM. Seasonal patterns in inorganic nutrient, POC, PON and chlorophyll-a concentrations, and Secchi depth were not significantly influenced by the 2013 increase in discharge. For other components, most notably {$\delta$}13C-DIC values, DOM and bacterioplankton, the influence of increased discharge in 2013 was superimposed upon their seasonal patterns. This study showed that in addition to tidal mixing and in situ saltmarsh and estuarine production and removal processes, the level of riverine freshwater discharge impacted the quantity and character of many water column components in this tidal saltmarsh ecosystem.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new way of using forward selection of explanatory variables in regression or canonical redundancy analysis. The classical forward selection method presents two problems: a highly inflated Type I error and an overestimation of the amount of explained variance. Correcting these problems will greatly improve the performance of this very useful method in ecological modeling. To prevent the first problem, we propose a two-step procedure. First, a global test using all explanatory variables is carried out. If, and only if, the global test is significant, one can proceed with forward selection. To prevent overestimation of the explained variance, the forward selection has to be carried out with two stopping criteria: (1) the usual alpha significance level and (2) the adjusted coefficient of multiple determination (Ra(2)) calculated using all explanatory variables. When forward selection identifies a variable that brings one or the other criterion over the fixed threshold, that variable is rejected, and the procedure is stopped. This improved method is validated by simulations involving univariate and multivariate response data. An ecological example is presented using data from the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, U.S.A.},

Dominant wind and current directions cause the appearance of gradients in physical conditions whereas biogeographical gradients can be the result of historical events (e.g. glaciations). No spatial modelling technique has been developed to this day that considers the direction of an asymmetric process controlling species distributions along a gradient or network. This paper presents a new method that can model species spatial distributions generated by a hypothesized asymmetric, directional physical process. This method is an eigenfunction-based spatial filtering technique that offers as much flexibility as the Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) framework; it is called asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM) modelling. information needed to construct eigenfunctions through the AEM framework are the spatial coordinates of the sampling or experimental sites, a connexion diagram linking the sites to one another, prior information about the direction of the hypothesized asymmetric process influencing the response variable(s), and optionally, weights attached to the edges (links). To illustrate how this new method works, AEM is compared to MEM analysis through simulations and in the analysis of an ecological example where a known asymmetric forcing is present. The ecological example reanalyses the dietary habits of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) sampled in 42 lakes of the Mastigouche Reserve, Quebec. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The monitoring of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in high northern latitude waters has been receiving increased focus due to the rapid environmental changes in the sub-Arctic, Arctic. Spaceborne optical instruments allow the continuous monitoring of the occurrence, distribution, and amount of Chl-a. In recent years, the Ocean and Land Color Instruments (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel 3 (S3) A and B satellites were launched, which provide data about various aquatic environments on advantageous spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions with high SNR. Although S3 OLCI could be favorable to monitor high northern latitude waters, there have been several challenges related to Chl-a concentration retrieval in these waters due to their unique optical properties coupled with challenging environments including high sun zenith angle, presence of sea ice, and frequent cloud covers. In this work, we aim to overcome these difficulties by developing a machine-learning (ML) approach designed to estimate Chl-a concentration from S3 OLCI data in high northern latitude optically complex waters. The ML model is optimized and requires only three S3 OLCI bands, reflecting the physical characteristic of Chl-a as input in the regression process to estimate Chl-a concentration with improved accuracy in terms of the bias (five times improvements.) The ML model was optimized on data from Arctic, coastal, and open waters, and showed promising performance. Finally, we present the performance of the optimized ML approach by computing Chl-a maps and corresponding certainty maps in highly complex sub-Arctic and Arctic waters. We show how these certainty maps can be used as a support to understand possible radiometric calibration issues in the retrieval of Level 2 reflectance over these waters. This can be a useful tool in identifying erroneous Level 2 Remote sensing reflectance due to possible failure of the atmospheric correction algorithm.},

Over the past decade, there has been a renewed interest in the properties and distribution of the major light-absorbing constituent of the \{DOM\} pool in natural waters (the 0.2 {$\mu$}m fraction). This material\textemdash referred in the past by various names such as Gelbstoff, yellow substance, gilvin, and humic substances) has more recently been provided the name chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). This designation more clearly highlights that this material absorbs not only visible light but also light in the UV-A (wavelengths from 315\textendash 400 nm) and UV-B (wavelengths from 280\textendash 315 nm), which are also part of the surface solar spectrum. By this definition\textemdash absorption at wavelengths over the range of surface solar radiation\textemdash CDOM represents only a portion of the total \{DOM\} pool. Although both ``CDOM'' and ``humic substances'' refer to the chemically complex, light-absorbing material produced by the decay of plant and algal matter, the use of ``CDOM'' is restricted to the material that is present in natural waters. However, the use of ``humic substances'' refers to material that is extractable from natural waters. This discrimination is necessary because the extracted materials are not always representative of those found in the original waters.},

  abstract = {Marine chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) imparts highly variable optical signatures in surface waters over short spatial and temporal scales, but the cause of that variability is poorly understood. A major fraction of dissolved organic matter in seawater is colloidal in size and can cycle quite rapidly, potentially contributing to the observed variability in CDOM. The relationship between marine colloids and CDOM optical variability was examined using flow field-flow fractionation (FlFFF) to partition the colloidal organic phase into a continuum of molecular sizes for optical characterization by excitation emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS). Colloidal organic matter in surface seawater of the Damariscotta River estuary showed 2 major peaks in apparent abundance, spanning at {$\sim$}1\textendash 5 kDa and {$\sim$}15\textendash 150 kDa in size, respectively. The relative magnitude of these peaks changed systematically with the phase of phytoplankton blooms during 2003 and 2004, implying a relationship between colloid size distribution and bloom dynamics. Of the two colloidal sizes, the 1\textendash 5 kDa fraction was far more variable in apparent abundance than the larger colloidal matter. EEMS results reveal a compositional partitioning of protein-like and humic-like fluorescence between size fractions. Protein-like materials occurred primarily in the smallest colloid size fraction while humic-type materials resided mainly in the larger colloidal phase. These findings suggest that the fluorescence signature of bulk dissolved organic matter results from a collage of chromophores having optical characteristics that differ according to size of the molecular constituents. The colloidal-sized fluorescence characteristics of marine derived CDOM were contrasted with bulk CDOM to provide fundamental information on the distribution and forms of CDOM in Maine coastal waters. The findings here indicate that colloidal processes will have significant effects on the character and variability in the optical signature of surface seawaters.},

  abstract = {[1] While most land models developed for use with climate models represent vegetation as discrete biomes, this is, at least for mixed life-form biomes, inconsistent with the leaf-level and whole-plant physiological parameterizations needed to couple these biogeophysical models with biogeochemical and ecosystem dynamics models. In this paper, we present simulations with the National Center for Atmospheric Research land surface model (NCAR LSM) that examined the effect of representing vegetation as patches of plant functional types (PFTs) that coexist within a model grid cell. This approach is consistent with ecological theory and models and allows for unified treatment of vegetation in climate and ecosystem models. In the standard NCAR LSM the PFT composition and leaf area for each grid cell are obtained by classifying grid cells as 1 of 28 possible biomes. Here, we develop a data set from 1-km satellite data that provides each model grid cell a unique PFT composition and leaf area for each PFT. Global simulations at 3degrees x 3degrees spatial resolution showed that ground temperature, ground evaporation, and northern high-latitude winter albedo exhibited direct responses to these landscape changes, which led to indirect effects such as in soil moisture and sensible and latent heat fluxes. Additional simulations at 2degrees x 2degrees and 1degrees x 1degrees spatial resolution showed that low-resolution simulations masked landscape heterogeneity in both approaches but the satellite-based, continuous representation of vegetation reduced model sensitivity to resolution. It is argued that the use of spatially continuous distributions of coexisting PFTs is a necessary step to link climate and ecosystem models.},

  abstract = {Changes in vegetation structure and biogeography due to climate change feedback to alter climate by changing fluxes of energy, moisture, and momentum between land and atmosphere. While the current class of land process models used with climate models parameterizes these fluxes in detail, these models prescribe surface vegetation and leaf area from data sets. In this paper, we describe an approach in which ecological concepts from a global vegetation dynamics model are added to the land component of a climate model to grow plants interactively. The vegetation dynamics model is the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) dynamic global vegetation model. The land model is the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Land Surface Model (LSM). Vegetation is defined in terms of plant functional types. Each plant functional type is represented by an individual plant with the average biomass, crown area, height, and stem diameter (trees only) of its population, by the number of individuals in the population, and by the fractional cover in the grid cell. Three time-scales (minutes, days, and years) govern the processes. Energy fluxes, the hydrologic cycle, and carbon assimilation, core processes in LSM, occur at a 20 min time step. Instantaneous net assimilated carbon is accumulated annually to update vegetation once a year. This is carried out with the addition of establishment, resource competition, growth, mortality, and fire parameterizations from LPJ. The leaf area index is updated daily based on prevailing environmental conditions, but the maximum value depends on the annual vegetation dynamics. The coupling approach is successful. The model simulates global biogeography, net primary production, and dynamics of tundra, boreal forest, northern hardwood forest, tropical rainforest, and savanna ecosystems, which are consistent with observations. This suggests that the model can be used with a climate model to study biogeophysical feedbacks in the climate system related to vegetation dynamics.},

The HPLC analyses showed that more than 98\% of the total pigment stocks occurred in the benthos. The phytoplankton contained Chrysophyceae, low concentrations of other protists and Cyanobacteria (notably picocyanobacteria), and the accessory pigments chl c(2), fucoxanthin, diadinoxanthin, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin. The benthic community contained the accessory pigments chl b, chl c(2), and a set of carotenoids dominated by glycosidic xanthophylls, characteristic of filamentous cyanobacteria. The black surface layer of the mats was rich in the UV-screening compounds scytonemin, red scytonemin-like, and mycosporine-like amino acids, and the blue-green basal stratum contained high concentrations of light-harvesting pigments. In a first bioassay of the benthic mats, there was no significant photosynthetic or growth response to inorganic carbon or full nutrient enrichment over 15 days. This bioassay was repeated with increased replication and HPLC analysis in a subsequent season, and the results confirmed the lack of significant response to added nutrients. In contrast, the phytoplankton in samples from the overlying water column responded strongly to enrichment, and chl a biomass increased by a factor of 19.2 over 2 weeks. These results underscore the divergent ecophysiology of benthic versus planktonic communities in extreme latitudes and show that cold lake ecosystems can be dominated by benthic phototrophs that are nutrient sufficient despite their ultraoligotrophic overlying waters.},

Phytoplankton had higher concentrations of photoprotective carotenoids per unit chlorophyll a than the phytobenthos.

A partial redundancy analysis showed that the benthic pigments were related to latitude, area and temperature. The UV-screening compound scytonemin occurred in high concentrations in the phytobenthos and was inversely related to temperature, while benthic carotenoids per unit chlorophyll a showed much lower variability among sites.

The travel starts with exploratory approaches, proceeds with the construction of association matrices, then addresses three families of methods: clustering, unconstrained and canonical ordination, and spatial analysis. All the necessary data files, the scripts used in the chapters, as well as the extra R functions and packages written by the authors, can be downloaded from a web page accessible through the Springer web site (http://www.bio.umontreal.ca/numecolR/).This book is aimed at professional researchers, practitioners, graduate students and teachers in ecology, environmental science and engineering, and in related fields such as oceanography, molecular ecology, agriculture and soil science, who already have a background in general and multivariate statistics and wish to apply this knowledge to their data using the R language, as well as people willing to accompany their disciplinary learning with practical applications.

Compared to a 2-year monitoring record on the mainstem Oubangui, these tributaries show a wide range of biogeochemical signatures, from highly diluted blackwaters (low turbidity, pH, conductivity, and total alkalinity) in rainforests to those more typical for savannah systems. Spectral analyses of chromophoric dissolved organic matter showed wide temporal variations in the Oubangui compared to spatio-temporal variations in the tributaries, and confirm that different pools of dissolved organic carbon are mobilized during different hydrological stages. {$\delta$}(13)C of dissolved inorganic carbon ranged between -28.1\textperthousand{} and -5.8\textperthousand, and was strongly correlated to both partial pressure of CO2 and to the estimated contribution of carbonate weathering to total alkalinity, suggesting an important control of the weathering regime on CO2 fluxes. All tributaries were oversaturated in dissolved greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O, CO2), with highest levels in rivers draining rainforest. The high diversity observed underscores the importance of sampling that covers the variability in subcatchment characteristics, to improve our understanding of biogeochemical cycling in the Congo Basin.},

  abstract = {Subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) layers are prevalent throughout the Arctic Ocean under stratified conditions and are observed both in the wake of retreating sea ice and in thermally stratified waters. The importance of these layers on the overall productivity of Arctic pelagic ecosystems has been a source of debate. In this study, we consider the three principal factors that govern productivity within SCMs: the shape of the chlorophyll profile, the photophysiological characteristics of phytoplankton and the availability of light in the layer. Using the information on the biological and optical parameters describing the vertical structure of chlorophyll, phytoplankton absorption and photosynthesis\textendash irradiance response curves, a spectrally resolved model of primary production is used to identify the set of conditions under which SCMs are important contributors to water-column productivity. Sensitivity analysis revealed systematic errors in the estimation of primary production when the vertical distribution of chlorophyll was not taken into account, with estimates of water-column production using a non-uniform profile being up to 97\% higher than those computed using a uniform one. The relative errors were shown to be functions of the parameters describing the shape of the biomass profile and the light available at the SCM to support photosynthesis. Given that SCM productivity is believed to be largely supported by new nutrients, it is likely that the relative contribution of SCMs to new production would be significantly higher than that to gross primary production. We discuss the biogeochemical and ecological implications of these findings and the potential role of new ocean sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles in furthering the study of SCMs in such highly heterogeneous and remote marine ecosystems.

Although these fractions seem ubiquitous in aquatic systems, little is known concerning the variation in the cytometric parameters used to characterize them. We have performed cytometric analyses of samples from a wide range of aquatic systems to determine the magnitude and variability in the cytometric characteristics of HNA/LNA. We show that neither group is associated to a fixed level of fluorescence and of light scatter. Rather, the relative position of HNA and LNA in the fluorescence versus side scatter cytograms varies greatly, both within and among ecosystems. Although the cytometric parameters of both groups tend to covary, there is often uncoupling between the two, particularly in light scatter. Our results show that, although the basic HNA/LNA configuration is present in most samples, its cytometric expression changes greatly in different ecosystems and along productivity gradients. The patterns in cytometric parameters do not support the simple, dichotomous view of HNA and LNA as active and inactive cells, or the notion of two distinct and independent communities, but rather suggest that there may be cells that are intrinsic to each fraction, as well as others that may exchange between fractions.},

Patterns of DOC in streamflow suggested that increased flows through the upper soil horizon during snowmelt are responsible for flushing this DOG-enriched interstitial water to the streams. We examined possible hydrological mechanisms to explain the observed variability of DOC in Deer Creek by first simulating the hydrological response of the catchment using TOPMODEL and then routing the predicted flows through a simple model that accounted for temporal changes in DOG. Conceptually the DOC model can be taken to represent a terrestrial (soil) reservoir in which DOC builds up during low now periods and is flushed out when infiltrating meltwaters cause the water table to rise into this ''reservoir''. Concentrations of DOC measured in the upper soil and in streamflow were compared to model simulations. The simulated DOC response provides a reasonable reproduction of the observed dynamics of DOC in the stream at Deer Creek.},

  abstract = {This study examines the effects of changes in St. Lawrence water levels and in hydrological regimes of two tributaries of the St. Lawrence, the Richelieu and Saint-Fran double dagger ois Rivers, on the sedimentary dynamics of their confluence in an historical context and in response to projected climate changes. Analysis of historical data indicates that alteration to St. Lawrence mean water levels and spring flood characteristics (duration, timing, and magnitude) have already impacted flow and sediment dynamics at tributary confluences. The major progradation of more than 1.5 km of the sedimentary front of the Saint-Fran double dagger ois delta into the shallow water of the fluvial Lake Saint-Pierre between 1859 and 2001 is associated with the combined effect of water level reduction in the lake, as a consequence of dredging of the navigation channel, and discharge regulation. High tributary discharges during periods of low water levels in the St. Lawrence have also contributed to accelerated delta front progression. Increases in temperature and changes in the precipitation regime projected for the current century were used into the HSAMI model to obtain hydrological simulations for the tributaries. Results indicate that the greatest hydrological changes will be observed during the winter and spring seasons, a time that is critical for many ecosystems. The mean spring discharge is projected to decrease by 17\% for the Richelieu and 40\% for the Saint-Fran double dagger ois by the end of the century. During this season, the frequency of discharge higher than the sediment transport threshold will decrease by 63\% for the Saint-Fran double dagger ois and by 17\% for Richelieu when compared to the reference period. However, during winter, the frequency of these high discharges will be four times higher for both rivers. These changes are expected to occur simultaneously with a decrease of the St. Lawrence water levels, a situation that will have significant impacts on sedimentary processes. A hydro-sedimentological modeling approach based on SEDROUT was used to investigate the morphological response of the river beds to the projected changes on the hydrology of St. Lawrence tributaries and to three base level scenarios. Results show that the combined hydrology and base level effects will lead to an increase in sediment supply compared to the current state, and to the extension of accumulation zones. While the effects will vary among the tributaries according to their particular characteristics, the projected increase in sediment supply will modify the extent of freshwater wetlands at the mouth of the St. Lawrence tributaries with feedback effects on local flow and sediment distributions.},

A novel approach was used to describe the shape of CDOM absorption between 250-700 nm (distribution of the spectral slope, S(lambda)) and a new fluorescence ratio is used to distinguish between humic and amino acid-like components. Solar ultraviolet irradiance, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), DOM fluorescence and absorption measurements were analysed and compared to other physicochemical parameters. We show that in the UV-exposed mixed layer: (i) fluorescence by autochthonous amino acid-like CDOM, (ii) values of S(lambda) across UV-C and UV-B wavebands increased during the summer months, whereas (i) average molar absorption coefficient and (ii) fluorescence by allochthonous humic CDOM decreased. In the unexposed deep layer of the water column (and in the entire water column in winter), humic-like CDOM presented high values of molar absorption coefficients and low values of S(lambda). UV attenuation coefficients correlated with both chlorophyll a concentrations and CDOM absorption. In agreement with changes in CDOM, minimal values in UV attenuation were found in summer. The S(lambda) curve was used as a signature of the mixture between photobleached and algal-derived CDOM with respect to the unexposed chromophoric dissolved compounds in this thermal stratified lake. Furthermore, S(lambda) curves were useful to distinguish between low and high molecular weight CDOM.},

Despite the increasing understanding about differences in carbon cycling between temperate and tropical freshwater systems, our knowledge on the importance of organic matter (OM) pools on light absorption properties in tropical lakes is very scarce. We performed a factorial mesocosm experiment in a tropical lake (Minas Gerais, Brazil) to evaluate the effects of increased concentrations of allochthonous and autochthonous OM, and differences in light availability on the light absorption characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Autochthonous OM deriving from phytoplankton ( {$\sim$} Chl a) was stimulated by addition of nutrients, while OM from degradation of terrestrial leaves increased allochthonous OM, and neutral shading was used to manipulate light availability. Effects of the additions and shading on DOC, Chl a, nutrients, total suspended solid concentrations (TSM) and spectral CDOM absorption were monitored every 3 days. CDOM quality was characterized by spectral indices (S250\textendash 450, S275\textendash 295, S350\textendash 450, SR and SUVA254). Effects of carbon sources and shading on the spectral CDOM absorption was investigated through principal component (PCA) and redundancy (RDA) analyses. The two different OM sources affected CDOM quality very differently and shading had minor effects on OM levels, but significant effects on OM quality, especially in combination with nutrient additions. Spectral indices (S250\textendash 450 and SR) were mostly affected by allochthonous OM addition. The PCA showed that enrichment by allochthonous carbon had a strong effect on the CDOM spectra in the range between 300 and 400nm, while the increase in autochthonous carbon increased absorption at wavelengths below 350nm. Our study shows that small inputs of allochthonous OM can have large effects on the spectral light absorption compared to large production of autochthonous OM, with important implications for carbon cycling in tropical lakes.},

A set of fifteen calibration samples was employed to build the multivariate model, selected using the Kennard-Stone methodology, starting from real Caliche samples whose nitrate content was previously determined using the reference Devarda method. The figures of merit of the multivariate model were satisfactory (the limit of detection and quantitation reached 0.04\% and 0.12 \% of NaNO3, respectively, with an average error of prediction of 0.3 \% of NaNO3). Then, the PLS model was then applied to a set of independent Caliche samples. The results were compared with a univariate UV approach, and with the nitrate content determined by the reference method, using the linear regression of predicted vs. reference concentration values, together with the elliptical joint confidence region test for the slope and intercept of the latter regression. The results ind\'icate that the univariate method is unsuitable for analyzing the presently studied samples, unlike the multivariate model. Finally, the analytical methodology proposed appears as reliable and cheap alternative for routine analysis of a large number of caliche samples.},

A survey of 46 thaw ponds in the Canadian arctic and subarctic regions showed that these ecosystems have high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and nutrients and are relatively productive. This activity was reflected in the optical properties of DOM that indicated a dominance of allochthonous sources but a significant contribution of low molecular weight compounds. Several subarctic ponds were stratified in summer, resulting in a hypoxic hypolimnion. Most ponds were supersaturated in CO2 and CH4, with higher gas concentrations in bottom waters. However, arctic thaw ponds colonized by benthic microbial mats showed lower CO2 concentrations, likely caused by active photosynthesis. CO2 was correlated with both the quantity and the optical properties of DOM, suggesting the significant role of dissolved compounds from melting organic soils and catchment vegetation on the balance between heterotrophy and autotrophy. The large variability observed in limnological properties of this series of ponds precludes generalisations about their role in greenhouse gas production. However, the fact that all thaw ponds were supersaturated in CH4 underscores the importance of estimating their global significance.},

Strong associations were also found between initial wavelengths of 226\textendash 239 nm and final wavelengths of 257\textendash 273 nm, which suggests that absorbing moieties in these ranges are prime precursors in the reaction mechanism to form THMs. A closer look noted that chlorinated THMs were more strongly associated than THMs in general; with brominated byproducts following closely to profiles of UV254 - indicating these parameters are closely related.},

  abstract = {A combination of new measurements and analysis of historical data from several geographic regions was used to address four issues that affect the reliability and interpretation of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measured by remote sensing of inland waters. First, high variability of CDOM levels in lakes and rivers was found at seasonal and multi-year time scales and at shorter intervals in some rivers and lakes. Coefficients of variation (CVs) of 30\%-50\% for absorptivity at 440nm (a440) were common in historical and new data sets we examined. CDOM values used to calibrate imagery thus should be measured close to the image acquisition date, preferably within 1-2 months in lakes and a few days in large rivers, unless it can be shown that CDOM levels are temporally stable over longer (or shorter) time periods in a given aquatic system. Second, spectral slopes (S) for CDOM in the visible range vary little over time (even over multi-year periods) within sites. Substantial variation was found between sites, however, and most spectra showed a change in slope near 460nm. Values of S400-460 for waters with moderate to high CDOM levels generally were within a narrow range ({\~ }0.014-0.018) and similar to reported S values in the near UV. Values of S400-460 for waters with low CDOM generally were smaller and more variable, as were values for S460-650 for all waters. Overall, the variability of spectral slopes in the visible range should not have a large effect on the reliability of a440 estimates made from remote sensing, which in many models involve reflectance measurements at wavelengths{$>$}500nm. Third, although a strong correlation (r2=0.925) was found between CDOM levels and DOC concentrations in 34 surface waters sampled in 2013, the standard error of estimate suggests an uncertainty of{\~ }??20\% in predicting DOC at a440=5m-1 (a moderate CDOM level). Moreover, CDOM-DOC relationships for unpublished data sets we analyzed and those reported in the literature indicate that both the fraction of DOC that is colored and slopes of regressions between CDOM and DOC are highly variable in space and time. Prediction of DOC concentrations in water bodies from CDOM levels (whether measured in the laboratory or by remote sensing) thus is associated with considerable uncertainty. For the present, this implies that field sampling is required to verify DOC concentrations predicted from remotely sensed CDOM measurements until we have a better understanding of variations in DOC-CDOM relationships. Fourth, shapes of reflectance spectra for CDOM-rich waters varied greatly depending on the concentrations of other constituents (suspended solids and chlorophyll) that affect the optical properties of water. Nonetheless, it is not obvious from our results for several predictive models that different remote sensing algorithms are needed to calculate CDOM levels accurately for waters where CDOM is the only variable affecting reflectance versus waters where other constituents also affect the spectra. The best band or band ratio models for simulated Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 bands from field measured reflectance spectra yielded high r2 values (0.84-0.86) for a440. The broader Landsat 8 bands worked nearly as well for a440 as the narrower Sentinel band sets and hyperspectral bands, probably because CDOM is characterized by a broad exponential increase in absorbance with decreasing wavelength rather than specific peaks or troughs in absorbance or reflectance.},

The use of 110-cm cells and then of 10-cm cells, with a highly sensitive spectrophotometer, allowed measurement throughout the UV-visible range (200-700 nm) even for the low concentrations of yellow substance encountered in the open sea. The concentration appears influenced predominantly by natural and industrial land discharges. In oceanic waters, it remains low and seems to be related to the biological activity averaged over a long period rather than to the local and temporary phytoplankton content. However, even at such low concentrations, yellow substance in the open sea may have an effect on absorption and hence on ocean color similar to that of low or moderate algal biomass. The spectral dependence law of absorption appears to vary within a restricted range, and an average law can be considered representative of rapid measurements at one selected wavelenght.},

PARAFAC is a generalization of PCA to higher order arrays, but some of the characteristics of the method are quite different from the ordinary two-way case. There is no rotation problem in PARAFAC, and e.g., pure spectra can be recovered from multi-way spectral data. One cannot as in PCA estimate components successively as this will give a model with poorer fit, than if the simultaneous solution is estimated. Finally scaling and centering is not as straightforward in the multi-way case as in the two-way case. An important advantage of using multi-way methods instead of unfolding methods is that the estimated models are very simple in a mathematical sense, and therefore more robust and easier to interpret. All these aspects plus more are explained in this tutorial and an implementation in Matlab code is available, that contains most of the features explained in the text. Three examples show how PARAFAC can be used for specific problems. The applications include subjects as: Analysis of variance by PARAFAC, a five-way application of PARAFAC, PARAFAC with half the elements missing, PARAFAC constrained to positive solutions and PARAFAC for regression as in principal component regression.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The Green Edge project was designed to investigate the onset, life, and fate of a phytoplankton spring bloom (PSB) in the Arctic Ocean. The lengthening of the ice-free period and the warming of seawater, amongst other factors, have induced major changes in Arctic Ocean biology over the last decades. Because the PSB is at the base of the Arctic Ocean food chain, it is crucial to understand how changes in the Arctic environment will affect it. Green Edge was a large multidisciplinary, collaborative project bringing researchers and technicians from 28 different institutions in seven countries together, aiming at understanding these changes and their impacts on the future. The fieldwork for the Green Edge project took place over two years (2015 and 2016) and was carried out from both an ice camp and a research vessel in Baffin Bay, in the Canadian Arctic. This paper describes the sampling strategy and the dataset obtained from the research cruise, which took place aboard the Canadian Coast Guard ship (CCGS) Amundsen in late spring and early summer 2016. The sampling strategy was designed around the repetitive, perpendicular crossing of the marginal ice zone (MIZ), using not only ship-based station discrete sampling but also high-resolution measurements from autonomous platforms (Gliders, BGC-Argo floats \ldots ) and under-way monitoring systems. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.17882/86417 (Bruyant et al., 2022).},

The chapter examines \{DOM\} in sediment pore waters with reference to several specific questions regarding (1) the composition and reactivity of pore-water DOM, (2) the controls on pore-water \{DOM\} concentrations, (3) the role of benthic \{DOM\} fluxes in the global ocean cycles of carbon and nitrogen, and (4) the role of pore-water \{DOM\} in sediment carbon preservation. The discussion in this chapter focuses on examining these questions in estuarine and continental margin sediments, in part because much of the detailed work in recent years on sediment \{DOM\} cycling has occurred in these sediments. Because the vast majority of carbon preservation and remineralization in all marine sediments occur in estuarine and continental margin sediments, there is also an important scientific justification for taking this approach. The chapter concludes with a discussion on Bioturbated and/or Bioirrigated Sediments model (BBS model).},

  abstract = {* Functional traits can be used to describe the composition of communities through indices that seek to explain the factors that drive community assembly, biotic effects on ecosystem processes or both. Appropriately representing functional composition is therefore essential for predicting the consequences of environmental context and management actions for the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services (ESs) in heterogeneous landscapes. * Functional indices can be constructed from single or multiple traits; however, it is not clear how they differ in information content or ability to predict biodiversity \textendash{} ecosystem function relationships in complex landscapes. Here, we compare the utility of analogous single- and multi-trait indices in linking environmental variation and functional composition to ESs in a heterogeneous landscape, relating functional indices based on three plant traits [height, relative growth rate and root density (RD)] to variation in the physical environment and to two ESs (forage production and soil carbon) and their net ES level. * Two orthogonal gradients, elevation and soil bulk density (BD), explained significant variation in several dimensions of functional composition comprised of single traits. These traits in turn significantly predicted variation in ESs and their net values. Only one index measured with multiple traits (functional richness) varied with the physical environment, while none predicted variation in ES or net ES levels. * One ES, soil carbon, increased with the community-average value of RD, while the other, forage production, was related to the range and community-average value of height. In turn, average RD increased with soil BD while the average and range of height declined with elevation. Due to these environmental patterns, soil carbon and forage production did not covary strongly, leading to moderate net ES levels across the landscape. * Synthesis: Single-trait indices of functional composition best linked variation in environmental gradients with productivity and soil carbon. Because the environment\textendash trait functioning relationships were independent of one another, the ESs were independently distributed across the landscape, providing little evidence of synergies or trade-offs. Single- and multi-trait indices contained unique information about functional composition of these communities, and both are likely to have a place in predicting variation in ESs under different scenarios.},

A 1.4-5.8\textdegree C warming by 2100 will likely change the sign of mean annual air and ground temperatures over much of the zones of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost in the northern hemisphere, causing widespread permafrost thaw. In this study, I examined rates of discontinuous permafrost thaw in the boreal peatlands of northern Manitoba, Canada, using a combination of tree-ring analyses to document thaw rates from 1941-1991 and direct measurements of permanent benchmarks established in 1995 and resurveyed in 2002. I used instrumented records of mean annual and seasonal air temperatures, mean winter snow depth, and duration of continuous snow pack from climate stations across northern Manitoba to analyze temporal and spatial trends in these variables and their potential impacts on thaw. Permafrost thaw in central Canadian peatlands has accelerated significantly since 1950, concurrent with a significant, late-20th-century average climate warming of +1.32\textdegree C in this region. There were strong seasonal differences in warming in northern Manitoba, with highest rates of warming during winter (+1.39\textdegree C to +1.66\textdegree C) and spring (+0.56\textdegree C to +0.78\textdegree C) at southern climate stations where permafrost thaw was most rapid. Projecting current warming trends to year 2100, I show that trends for north-central Canada are in good agreement with general circulation models, which suggest a 4-8\textdegree C warming at high latitudes. This magnitude of warming will begin to eliminate most of the present range of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost in central Canada by 2100. \textcopyright{} 2005 Springer.}

Fluorescence spectroscopy has been proposed as a promising method for characterizing DOM, but few links have been demonstrated between DOM fluorescence and DOM composition or the processes affected by DOM composition. In 28 southern Quebec lakes, tryptophan-like DOM fluorescence (T-FDOM) was found to be a much better descriptor of rates of heterotrophic bacterial metabolism than dissolved organic carbon, describing 52\%, 44\%, 51\%, and 55\% of the variability in bacterial production, bacterioplankton respiration, total bacterial carbon consumption, and total plankton community respiration, respectively. In addition, evidence from a series of bacterial regrowth cultures suggests that T-FDOM represents a product of bacterial activity as well as, to a lesser extent, a bioavailable substrate. Our results instead raise the intriguing possibility that T-FDOM concentration reflects a balance between its production and consumption by bacteria. We demonstrate here that fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to identify a highly dynamic fraction of DOM related to bacterial metabolism in lakes.},

Twelve algorithms, developed by 10 teams, were evaluated by comparing their ability to estimate depth-integrated daily production (IP, mg C m(-2)) at 89 stations in geographically diverse provinces. Algorithms were furnished information about the surface chlorophyll concentration, temperature, photosynthetic available radiation, latitude, longitude, and day of the year. Algorithm results were then compared with IP estimates derived from (14)C uptake measurements at the same stations. Estimates from the best-performing algorithms were generally within a factor of 2 of the (14)C-derived estimates. Many algorithms had systematic biases that can possibly be eliminated by reparameterizing underlying relationships. The performance of the algorithms and degree of correlation with each other were independent of the algorithms' complexity.},

  abstract = {The effects of habitat fragmentation and their implications for biodiversity is a central issue in conservation biology which still lacks an overall comprehension. There is not yet a clear consensus on how to quantify fragmentation even though it is quite common to couple the effects of habitat loss with habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. Here we address the spatial patterns of species distribution in fragmented landscapes, assuming a neutral community model. To build up the fragmented landscapes, we employ the fractional Brownian motion approach, which in turn permits us to tune the amount of habitat loss and degree of clumping of the landscape independently. The coupling between the neutral community model, here simulated by means of the coalescent method, and fractal neutral landscape models enables us to address how the species-area relationship changes as the spatial patterns of a landscape is varied. The species-area relationship is one of the most fundamental laws in ecology, considered as a central tool in conservation biology, and is used to predict species loss following habitat disturbances. Our simulation results indicate that the level of clumping has a major role in shaping the species-area relationship. For instance, more compact landscapes are more sensitive to the effects of habitat loss and speciation rate. Besides, the level of clumping determines the existence and extension of the power-law regime which is expected to hold at intermediate scales. The distributions of species abundance are strongly influenced by the degree of fragmentation. We also show that the first and second commonest species have approximately self-similar spatial distributions across scales, with the fractal dimensions of the support of the first and second commonest species being very robust to changes in the spatial patterns of the landscape.},

In aquatic systems, which have much lower oxygen concentrations than the atmosphere, vascular aquatic plants can affect oxygen concentrations significantly not only on long time scales but also on time scales of less than a day. Aquatic plants are generally thought of as adding oxygen to aquatic systems through photosynthesis, but the impact of vascular aquatic plants on oxygen varies greatly with plant morphology. Floating-leaved plants that vent oxygen to the atmosphere can strongly deplete oxygen. In some ecosystems where floating-leaved plants have replaced submersed vegetation, oxygen concentrations have been substantially reduced. These oxygen changes can have cascading impacts on nutrient and trace gas chemistry and on the suitability of plant beds as habitat for invertebrates and fishes.}

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is operationally defined as organic matter that passes a GF/F or a 0.2{$\mu$}m filter. \{DOM\} represents one of the largest exchangeable carbon reservoirs on earth. The global dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool is estimated to be 685 Gt C\textemdash a value comparable to the mass of inorganic carbon in the atmosphere. Net oceanic uptake of \{CO2\} is approximately 2.1 Gt per year, a small percentage of the oceanic \{DOC\} pool. Small perturbations in the production or sink terms of the oceanic \{DOC\} pool could strongly impact the balance between oceanic and atmospheric CO2. Thus, processes that control \{DOM\} production, consumption, and distribution are biogeochemically significant with regard to carbon export. Inorganic nutrient limitation control of \{DOM\} accumulation remains an interesting hypothesis but evidence of its support is ambiguous. Finally, spatial variability of microbial community structure may also play a major role in the processing and cycling of recalcitrant compounds.},

The Arctic Ocean is\textemdash{} together with the Greenland, Iceland, and Labrador seas\textemdash a major area of deep-water formation in the Northern Hemisphere. As this deep water contributes to the global thermohaline circulation and adds to the deep waters of all global oceans, it is of global interest to evaluate the vertical flux of \{DOM\} within the Arctic Ocean (and the other deep-water formation sites). To address various aspects of DOM, it is essential to consider the water mass formation and circulation within the area. With regard to the total carbon budget in and out of the Arctic Ocean, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes are about 5\% of the total carbon fluxes\textemdash calculated as the sum of inorganic and organic carbon. However, while the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration largely has a positive correlation with salinity, the \{DOC\} concentration has a negative one. Consequently, in situ production and respiration of \{DOC\} plays a relatively more important role for the carbon cycle in the low-salinity surface waters\textemdash relative to deeper layers\textemdash and it is the surface water that is in contact with the atmosphere linking the marine carbon cycle to climate.},

This theory has focused mostly on total energy as a measure of energy availability. However, because energy variation can also influence population sizes and extinction rates, species-energy theory should arguably consider simultaneously both total energy and its variation. Using data on species richness of land birds and mammals, we compared the fit of three species-energy models including total energy, energy variation or both combined. We show that the combination of total energy and energy variation has greater predictive power than any of them considered separately. We also evaluate three crucial assumptions of this modified species-energy theory and show that they are supported by available data. These results illuminate the current debate on climate change, given that both average conditions and variability of climatic conditions are likely to change in the future. 2010 The Authors.}

A coupled algae-bacteria relationship mediated by C released from algae was observed during a 2-yr period (1996-1997) in an oligotrophic high mountain lake, except at upper depths. The intensity of photosynthetically active radiation was negatively related to primary production, and the highest percentages of excretion of organic carbon (\%EOC) from algae were found at upper depths of the water column. The effect of different spectral regions of solar radiation on the algae-bacteria relationship was assessed by in situ experiments, in which the exposure, tracer uptake by target organisms, and interactions among abiotic and biotic factors were simultaneous. Primary production was ultraviolet radiation (UVR) inhibited by 33-83\% depending on depth and date, with ultraviolet-A radiation (UVA) exerting the main effect. EOC and \%EOC yielded highest values under UVR exposure. Sunlight affected bacterial production (BP) only at upper depths. UVB inhibited BP by 39-82\%, whereas UVA + photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and PAR enhanced BP three- to fourfold. Full sunlight increased BP 2.5-fold in midsummer but inhibited it (37\%) in the late open-water period. The percentage of photosynthetic exudates assimilated by bacteria, and photosynthetic carbon use efficiency by bacteria, showed a similar pattern to that of BP. The experimental results support our hypothesis that increased organic C release from UV-stressed algae stimulates bacterial growth if the bacteria are relatively well adapted to sunlight, determining a coupled algae-bacteria relationship. Thus, sunlight may play a key role as the underlying abiotic factor that regulates algae-bacteria interaction in shallow and clear-water ecosystems.},

  abstract = {While the four-dimensional nature of river ecosystems has been recognized for nearly two decades, the role of lateral complexity has rarely been factored into studies of zooplankton ecology. We examined the importance of hydrologic retention areas (slackwaters) near islands and embayments of the St. Lawrence River for densities, fecundity, and diel migration of planktonic microcrustaceans. Densities of cladocera and copepods (nauplii and adult stages of cyclopoids and calanoids) were sampled from surface and deeper layers both at night (2100-0100 h, near the new moon) and during the day (1000-1400 h) for channel (deep-fast), offshore (shallow-slower), and inshore (shallow-stagnant) habitats. Average zooplankton densities increased laterally from the main channel into the slackwaters with the exception of calanoid copepods, which peaked in the intermediate depths and flows of the offshore habitats. Although the ratio of males to females for the calanoid Eurytemora affinis and the cladoceran Bosmina spp. did not differ among habitats, a greater percentage of ovigerous cladoceran females were present in slackwaters than in channel habitats. Densities of microcrustaceans were generally greater during the night than day, suggesting diel vertical migration. By demonstrating both lateral and diel differences in the spatial distribution of riverine zooplankton, we refute the view of large rivers as well-mixed homogenous systems. To the contrary, the two non-random patterns that we document imply that there is an abiotic template that at least microcrustacean potamoplankton can exploit. In turn this suggests more research into the ecological significance of the pelagic structure of other large rivers like the St. Lawrence is justified. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The chapter emphasizes the processes that occur in rivers and estuaries and are important to marine DOM. The river inputs to the coastal zone together with the intense physical and biological activity in coastal waters and hence, it makes that part of the marine realm one of the most dynamic in terms of DOM. Globally, riverine inputs of \{DOM\} represent about 0.25 Gt C per year. Despite its refractory character\textemdash recognized by many authors\textemdash a relatively large fraction of that \{DOM\} is degraded after mixing with seawater, with turnover times ranging from days to years. \{DOM\} behavior is also modified by the physical\textendash chemical processes occurring in the mixing zone\textemdash particularly flocculation and photo oxidation. These processes affect the structure and the biodegradability of organic matter, thereby influencing the fate of \{DOM\} in the coastal zone. In addition to riverine inputs, seasonal autochthonous production contributes to a large amount of \{DOM\} present in the coastal zone. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the mechanisms of \{DOM\} accumulation and export from coastal realms.},

By using a combination of hydrogeological and marine geochemical approaches, the objective was to analyze and quantify submarine groundwater discharge processes through a boreal beach after the snow melt period, in early June. The distribution of {$\delta$}18O and {$\delta$}2H in beach groundwater showed that inland fresh groundwater contributed between 97 and 30\% of water masses presented within the STE. A time series of water table levels during the 16 days of the study indicated that tides propagated as a dynamic wave limiting the mass displacement of seawater within the STE. This up-and-down movement of the water table ({$\sim$}10\textendash 30 cm) induced the vertical infiltration of seawater at the falling tide. At the front of the beach, a radon-based mass balance calculated with high-resolution 222Rn survey estimated total SGD of 3.1 m3/m/d at the discharge zone and a mean flow to 1.5 m3/m/d in the bay. The nearshore discharge agreed relatively well with Darcy fluxes calculated at the beach face. Fresh groundwater makes up more than 50\% of the total discharge during the measuring campaign. These results indicate that beaches in boreal and cold regions could be important sources of freshwater originate and groundwater-borne solutes and contaminants to the marine environment after the snowmelt.},

Transplant experiments in which Potamogeton pectinatus was grown in pails containing three sediments differing in texture at three sites with different current velocities also demonstrated that biomass and shoot density were affected by both the direct effects of current velocity on plant shoots and its indirect effects on sediment nutrient concentrations.

Between 1986 and 2006/2007, mean annual water colour increased in all the sub-catchments. However, there was considerable varia-tion in the increase, which ranged from 22 to 155\%. Statistical analysis revealed that the sub-catchments could be split into two 'types' based on water chemistry and therefore dominant source of runoff; type 1 where flow was dominated by runoff from peat and type 2 where a greater contribution of flow appears to originate from mineral soil horizons, as indicated by the higher silicon, base cation concen-trations and pH values. Largest proportional increases in water colour were observed in the sub-catchments that had the smaller mean annual water colour values in 1986 which were, in general, the type 2 sub-catchments. The higher rate of water colour increase in the type 2 catchments, in comparison to the type 1 catchments, may be related to changes in adsorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within the mineral horizons of the organo-mineral soils on the lower catchment slopes possibly as a result of changes in acid sulphur deposition.},

Aerial photographs from 1964(1967) for the Saint Maurice, Saint Fran\c{c}ois, Richelieu, Batiscan and Yamachiche Rivers were compared with 1997 photographs to quantify changes in vegetation and land use. The riparian zones were divided into five cover types to create landscape cover maps: herbaceous vegetation, woody vegetation, agriculture, urban and water. The maps were converted into a geographic information system to quantify landscape changes, which were attributed to either natural processes, such as sediment deposition and bank erosion, or anthropogenic influences, such as human settlement. The results show that both natural and anthropogenic changes were limited over the 30-year study period and that natural processes dominated over human-caused impacts. Overall, riparian vegetation patches became more fragmented and isolated with time due to the disturbances. However, important differences were observed between and within rivers. Fluvial processes resulted in riparian vegetation losses on three rivers (Richelieu, Saint Fran\c{c}ois and Batiscan) and gains on the other two rivers (Yamachiche and Saint Maurice) while anthropogenic influences resulted in vegetation gains on four rivers, except the Richelieu where gains and losses were equivalent. Thus, while riparian landscapes are sensitive to both fluvial and anthropogenic processes, there is great variability in sensitivity among the tributaries. By providing a better understanding of past changes, studies such as this can help make better predictions of future changes that are expected to occur with climate change.

A primary cause for this pattern is the heterogeneity in the amount of energy, or primary productivity (the rate of carbon fixed through photosynthesis), available to the biota in a given location. But the shape of the relationship between productivity and species diversity is highly variable. In many cases, the relationship is 'hump-shaped', where diversity peaks at intermediate productivity. In other cases, diversity increases linearly with productivity. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that data are often collected at different spatial scales. If the mechanisms that determine species diversity vary with spatial scale, then so would the shape of the productivity-diversity relationship. Here, we present evidence for scale-dependent productivity-diversity patterns in ponds. When the data were viewed at a local scale (among ponds), the relationship was hump-shaped, whereas when the same data were viewed at a regional scale (among watersheds), the relationship was positively linear. This dependence on scale results because dissimilarity in local species composition within regions increased with productivity.},

A selective overview of the empirical evidence for and against this theory is provided, with a special emphasis on tropical plant communities. The neutral theory predicts many of the basic patterns of biodiversity, confirming its heuristic power. The strict assumption of equivalence that defines neutrality, equivalence among individuals, finds little empirical support in general. However, a weaker assumption holds for stable communities, the equivalence of average fitness among species. One reason for the surprising success of the neutral theory is that all the theories of species coexistence satisfying the fitness equivalence assumption, including many theories of niche differentiation, generate exactly the same patterns as the neutral theory. Hubbell's neutral theory represents an important synthesis and a much needed demonstration of the pivotal role of intraspecific variability in ecology. Further improvements should lead to an explicit linking to niche-based processes. This research programme will depend crucially on forthcoming theoretical and empirical achievements.},

Complex mixing, photodegradation, and biological processes make differentiation of the specific sources of CDOM difficult. Using a combination of high resolution in situ observations on an undulating vehicle, the ECOShuttle, a pumping system mounted on the vehicle, and detailed chemical and biological analyses of discrete samples allowed us to characterize two specific sources of CDOM in the Louisiana Bight: the river water constrained in the upper 12 m of the Mississippi River plume and several subsurface layers of CDOM below the plume. The subsurface CDOM maxima were coincident with steep pycnoclines and sometimes with maxima in chlorophyll a fluorescence. Both sources were actively supplying CDOM to the same location by entirely different processes. The subsurface CDOM was more biologically labile and photochemically refractory than the surface CDOM. Optical properties were also different with a relatively higher protein fluorescence and a lower spectral slope coefficient in the subsurface CDOM. The geographical extent of the two sources was determined by three-dimensional mapping of the area, and due to the relatively calm conditions in the summer of 2000, thin layers of CDOM produced in the subsurface were observed throughout the region. While riverine inputs dominated the distribution of CDOM in surface waters {$<$}12 m in depth, biological production of CDOM, probably due to the bacterial degradation of phytoplankton produced DOM dominated the subsurface waters. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Near-exclusive focus on the secondary effect of these forms of harshness has led ecologists to believe that they reduce the importance of ecological interactions, such as competition, and favor coexistence of even ecologically very similar species. By examining both the costs and the benefits, we show that harshness alone does not lessen the importance of species interactions or limit their role in community structure. Species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely. Fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., disturbance, seasonal change, and weather variation) also have been regarded as decreasing species interactions and favoring coexistence, but we argue that coexistence can only be favored when fluctuations create spatial or temporal niche opportunities. We argue that important diversity-promoting roles for harsh and fluctuating conditions depend on deviations from the assumptions of additive effects and linear dependencies most commonly found in ecological models. Such considerations imply strong roles for species interactions in the diversity of a community.},

Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

In this study, the antipredator behaviours of juvenile roach (Rutilus rutilus) and juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis) were studied in wading pools with three kinds of structural complexity: no structure, structure simulating vegetation and structure simulating bottom crevices. Predation experiments with piscivorous perch and habitat choice experiments with the prey were performed, and the foraging success and prey choice of the predators were related to the type of structure. Predator foraging success was lower in the vegetation than in the other treatments. In the absence of structure and with vegetation structure, predators preferred perch over roach, while the preference was reversed in the crevice treatment. Roach and perch differed in their antipredatory behaviours. Roach responded to the presence of predators by schooling, moving fast and remaining at the surface, and escaped from attacks by jumping out of the water. In contrast, perch moved more slowly, dispersed after attacks and tried to hide at the bottom. Perch always preferred the vegetation structure to the non-structured part of the pool, while roach showed preference for the vegetation structure only when predators were present. Roach never occurred in crevices, whereas perch used crevices when predators where present. Predator pursuit speed was lower in the vegetation structure than in the non-structured treatment, but prey escape speed was unaffected. The results suggest that both the quantity and quality of structural complexity interacting with species-specific antipredator behaviours are important for predator-prey dynamics. It is also suggested that the presence of structure can have substantial effects on the structure of North Eurasian fish communities, by affecting relative and absolute predation pressures from piscivorous perch on prey species.},

This new paradigm of the ``microbial loop'' developed contemporaneously with a heightened interest in the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle\textemdash following the realization that changes in ocean biogeochemistry may have forced changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide during glacial periods, and that a large ``missing sink'' for atmospheric carbon dioxide existed in which the ocean biota might play a role. Although the literature of ocean biogeochemical modeling has sometimes been concerned with one or the other of these developments without explicitly linking the two (i.e., the microbial food web is highly parameterized in some ocean biogeochemical models, and some microbial food web models are concerned primarily with organism interactions rather than biogeochemical cycles), at least some investigators drew the connection quite early on. Nonetheless, the development of modeling in the study of dissolved organic matter in the oceans has advanced rapidly over the past decade. While there are many remaining uncertainties, and many of the results cited are quite tentative, a fair amount of progress has been made. A variety of sophisticated new models have been developed in a simplified physical context and their ability to simulate spatial and temporal variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its effects on large-scale ocean biogeochemistry will hopefully be evaluated in the near future.},

These data were used to develop our understanding of light attenuation dynamics in the IRL and for verification of a numerical light model. Data from our study show that tripton (non-algal particulate matter calculated from TSS and ch1 a corrected for pheophytin) has a dominant effect on light attenuation in the IRL. For each synoptic event, there exists a positive correlation between the event-averaged downwelling light attenuation coefficient, K-d(PAR), and event-averaged tripton concentration. A negative correlation is found between the event-averaged K-d(PAR) and the event-averaged color, while a positive correlation is found between event-averaged K-d(PAR) and event-averaged ch1 a concentration. The correlation between event-averaged tripton and event-averagedK(d)(PAR) is the only one of the three to show significance at the 0.05 level. Relative contributions of color, ch1 a, and tripton to light attenuation were found to be 5-25\%, 10-26\%, and 59-78\% of K-d(PAR), respectively. These values depend on the method for partitioning K-d(PAR) and the method for obtaining average value of relative partitioned K-d(PAR) from all the data points. These values show that tripton has a more dominant influence on light attenuation in the IRL than in Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, but comparable to that in Florida Bay. The effect of suspended chlorophyll on light attenuation in the IRL is less than that in Tampa Bay, comparable to Charlotte Harbor, but more than that in Florida Bay. A numerical process-based light attenuation model has been developed to calculate K-d(PAR) based on measured or simulated values of TSS, color, and ch1 a. The model was found to give reasonable estimates of K-d(PAR) throughout the IRL. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The paradox of biodiversity involves three elements, (i) mathematical models predict that species must differ in specific ways in order to coexist as stable ecological communities, (ii) such differences are difficult to identify, yet (iii) there is widespread evidence of stability in natural communities. Debate has centred on two views. The first explanation involves tradeoffs along a small number of axes, including 'colonization-competition', resource competition (light, water, nitrogen for plants, including the 'successional niche'), and life history (e.g. high-light growth vs. low-light survival and few large vs. many small seeds). The second view is neutrality, which assumes that species differences do not contribute to dynamics. Clark et al. (2004) presented a third explanation, that coexistence is inherently high dimensional, but still depends on species differences. We demonstrate that neither traditional low-dimensional tradeoffs nor neutrality can resolve the biodiversity paradox, in part by showing that they do not properly interpret stochasticity in statistical and in theoretical models. Unless sample sizes are small, traditional data modelling assures that species will appear different in a few dimensions, but those differences will rarely predict coexistence when parameter estimates are plugged into theoretical models. Contrary to standard interpretations, neutral models do not imply functional equivalence, but rather subsume species differences in stochastic terms. New hierarchical modelling techniques for inference reveal high-dimensional differences among species that can be quantified with random individual and temporal effects (RITES), i.e. process-level variation that results from many causes. We show that this variation is large, and that it stands in for species differences along unobserved dimensions that do contribute to diversity. High dimensional coexistence contrasts with the classical notions of tradeoffs along a few axes, which are often not found in data, and with 'neutral models', which mask, rather than eliminate, tradeoffs in stochastic terms. This mechanism can explain coexistence of species that would not occur with simple, low-dimensional tradeoff scenarios.},

Over the last eight years several hypotheses have been put forward to explain these increases, but none are yet accepted universally. Research in this area appears to have reached a stalemate between those favouring declining atmospheric deposition, climate change or land management as the key driver of long-term DOC trends. While it is clear that many of these factors influence DOC dynamics in soil and stream waters, their effect varies over different temporal and spatial scales. We argue that regional differences in acid deposition loading may account for the apparent discrepancies between studies. DOC has shown strong monotonic increases in areas which have experienced strong downward trends in pollutant sulphur and/or seasalt deposition. Elsewhere climatic factors, that strongly influence seasonality, have also dominated inter-annual variability, and here long-term monotonic DOC trends are often difficult to detect. Furthermore, in areas receiving similar acid loadings, different catchment characteristics could have affected the site specific sensitivity to changes in acidity and therefore the magnitude of DOC release in response to changes in sulphur deposition. We suggest that confusion over these temporal and spatial scales of investigation has contributed unnecessarily to the disagreement over the main regional driver(s) of DOC trends, and that the data behind the majority of these studies is more compatible than is often conveyed. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The large number of disparate metrics used to quantify functional diversity reflects the range of attributes underlying this concept, generally summarized as functional richness, functional evenness, and functional divergence. However, in practice, we know very little about which attributes drive which ecosystem functions, due to a lack of field-based tests. Here we test the association between eight leading functional diversity metrics (Rao's Q, FD, FDis, FEve, FDiv, convex hull volume, and species and functional group richness) that emphasize different attributes of functional diversity, plus 11 extensions of these existing metrics that incorporate heterogeneous species abundances and trait variation. We assess the relationships among these metrics and compare their performances for predicting three key ecosystem functions (above- and belowground biomass and light capture) within a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment. Many metrics were highly correlated, although unique information was captured in FEve, FDiv, and dendrogram-based measures (FD) that were adjusted by abundance. FD adjusted by abundance outperformed all other metrics in predicting both above- and belowground biomass, although several others also performed well (e.g. Rao's Q, FDis, FDiv). More generally, trait-based richness metrics and hybrid metrics incorporating multiple diversity attributes outperformed evenness metrics and single-attribute metrics, results that were not changed when combinations of metrics were explored. For light capture, species richness alone was the best predictor, suggesting that traits for canopy architecture would be necessary to improve predictions. Our study provides a comprehensive test linking different attributes of functional diversity with ecosystem function for a grassland system.},

These hypotheses frequently fail to distinguish between fundamentally different forms of energy which influence diversity in dissimilar ways. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) can be utilized only by plants, though their abundance and growth rate is also greatly influenced by water. The Gibbs free energy (chemical energy) retained in the reduced organic compounds of tissue can be utilized by all heterotrophic organisms. Neither PAR nor chemical energy influences diversity directly. Both, however, influence biomass and/or abundance; diversity may then increase as a result of secondary population dynamic or evolutionary processes. Temperature is not a form of energy, though it is often used loosely by ecologists as a proxy for energy; it does, however, influence the rate of utilization of chemical energy by organisms. It may also influence diversity by allowing a greater range of energetic lifestyles at warmer temperatures (the metabolic niche hypothesis). We conclude that there is no single species/energy mechanism; fundamentally different processes link energy to abundance in plants and animals, and diversity is affected secondarily. If we are to make progress in elucidating these mechanisms, it is important to distinguish climatic effects on species' distribution and abundance from processes linking energy supply to plant and animal diversity.},

Previous work has identified habitat alterations and invasive species as the major drivers of recent bird extinctions. Here, we extend this work to ask how these human-driven impacts differentially affect extinction-prone taxa, and if any specific driver promotes taxonomic homogenization of avifauna. Like most previous studies, our analysis is based on global information of extinction drivers affecting threatened and extinct bird species from the IUCN Red List. Unlike previous studies, we employ a multivariate statistical framework that allows us to identify the main gradients of variation in extinction drivers. By using these gradients, we show that bird families with the highest extinction risk are primarily associated with threats posed by invasive species, once species richness and phylogeny are taken into account. As expected, the negative impact of invasive species was higher on island species, but our results also showed that it was particularly high in those species with small distribution ranges. On the other hand, mainland species and island species with large ranges tended to be affected by habitat destruction. Thus the impacts of invasive species promote the process of taxonomic homogenization among islands and between islands and continents. Consequently, introduced species may increase biotic homogenization not only directly, as generally believed, but also indirectly through their disproportional impact on endemic species imperilment.},

One such important property is the concentration of chlorophyll-a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass that serves a multitude of purposes in various ocean science studies. Here, the performance of two generic chlorophyll-a algorithms (i.e., a band ratio one, Ocean Colour X (OCx), and a semi-analytical one, Garver\textendash Siegel Maritorena (GSM)) was assessed against two large in situ datasets of chlorophyll-a concentration collected between 1999 and 2016 in the Northeast Pacific (NEP) and Northwest Atlantic (NWA) for three ocean colour sensors: Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). In addition, new regionally-tuned versions of these two algorithms are presented, which reduced the mean error (mg m-3) of chlorophyll-a concentration modelled by OCx in the NWA from -0.40, -0.58 and -0.45 to 0.037, -0.087 and -0.018 for MODIS, SeaWiFS, and VIIRS respectively, and -0.34 and -0.36 to -0.0055 and -0.17 for SeaWiFS and VIIRS in the NEP. An analysis of the uncertainties in chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval showed a strong seasonal pattern in the NWA, which could be attributed to changes in phytoplankton community composition, but no long-term trends were found for all sensors and regions. It was also found that removing the 443 nm waveband for the OCx algorithms significantly improved the results in the NWA. Overall, GSM performed better than the OCx algorithms in both regions for all three sensors but generated fewer chlorophyll-a retrievals than the OCx algorithms.},

  abstract = {High-resolution fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM) in concentrated and unconcentrated water samples from a wide variety of freshwater, coastal and marine environments. Several types of fluorescent signals were observed, including humic-like, tyrosine-like, and tryptophan-like. Humic-like fluorescence consisted of two peaks, one stimulated by UV excitation (peak A) and one by visible excitation (peak C). For all samples, the positions of both excitation and emission maxima for peak C were dependent upon wavelength of observation, with a shift towards longer wavelength emission maximum at longer excitation wavelength and longer wavelength excitation maximum at longer emission wavelength. A trend was observed in the position of wavelength-independent maximum fluorescence (Ex(max)/Em(max)) for peak C, with maximum at shorter excitation and emission wavelengths for marine samples than for freshwater samples. Mean positions of these maxima were: rivers Ex(max)/Em(max) = 340/448 nm; coastal water Ex(max)/Em(max) = 342/442 nm; marine shallow transitional Ex(max)/Em(max) = 310/423 nm; marine shallow eutrophic Ex(max)/Em(max) = 299/389 nm; and marine deep Ex(max)/Em(max) = 340/438 nm. Differences suggest that the humic material in marine surface waters is chemically different from humic material in the other environments sampled. These results explain previous conflicting reports regarding fluorescence properties of DOM from natural waters and also provide a means of distinguishing between water mass sources in the ocean.},

  abstract = {In all ecosystems, bacteria are the most numerous organisms and through them flows a large fraction of annual primary production. In the past decade we have learned a great deal about some of the factors that regulate bacteria and their activities, and how these activities, in turn, alter ecosystem-level processes. Here I review three areas in which recent progress has been made with particular reference to pelagic ecosystems: the problem of bacterial cell dormancy; the effect of solar radiation on organic matter lability; and, the maintenance of net heterotrophy. In a system in which grazing is the major source of mortality for bacteria, bacterial cell dormancy is something of a paradox. I argue that the degree to which bacteria are grazed by flagellates (highly selective grazers) versus other grazers (cladocerans, bivalves) may explain the degree and variation in the proportion of active cells which recent evidence shows to be large. Another factor affecting bacterial activity that has come to the fore in recent years is solar radiation. Irradiation, especially in the ultra-violet range has long been thought of as simply deleterious to some bacteria. A wealth of newer evidence shows that refractory dissolved organic compounds may be converted into microbially labile compounds by solar radiation in several wavebands. This interaction between irradiation and organic matter (photolysis) may explain, in part, how dissolved organic carbon (C) may be refractory in the dark environment of the soil but become labile in the illumunated surface waters of lakes or rivers. The newer evidence shows that aquatic ecosystems, at least oligotrophic ones, are significantly subsidized by terrestrially-produced organic matter. I review here multiple lines of evidence that suggest that freshwater ecosystems are predominantly systems which respire more organic C than they produce by photosynthesis, and are therefore net heterotrophic. While net heterotrophy is an interesting exception for terrestrial ecosystems, it appears to be commonplace for aquatic systems and represents an important linkage between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.},

Four whole-lake additions of dissolved inorganic C-13 were made to reveal the pathways of subsidies to lakes from terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (t-DOC), terrestrial particulate organic carbon (t-POC) and terrestrial prey items. Terrestrial DOC, the largest input, was a major subsidy of pelagic bacterial respiration, but little of this bacterial C was passed up the food web. Zooplankton received {$<$} 2\% of their C from the t-DOC to bacteria pathway. Terrestrial POC significantly subsidized the production of both zooplankton and benthic invertebrates, and was passed up the food web to Chaoborus and fishes. This route supplied 33-73\% of carbon flow to zooplankton and 20-50\% to fishes in non-fertilized lakes. Terrestrial prey, by far the smallest input, provided some fishes with {$>$} 20\% of their carbon. The results show that impacts of cross-ecosystem subsidies depend on characteristics of the imported material, the route of entry into the food web, the types of consumers present, and the productivity of the recipient system.},

  abstract = {Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth's surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y(-1) from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y(-1) is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

Although cross-ecosystem subsidies between terrestrial and aquatic systems have been well recognized for benthic organisms in streams, rivers, and the littoral zones of lakes, terrestrial subsidies to pelagic consumers are more difficult to demonstrate and remain controversial. Here, we adopt a unique approach by using stable isotopes of H, C, and N to estimate terrestrial support to zooplankton in two contrasting lakes. Zooplankton (Holopedium, Daphnia, and Leptodiaptomus) are comprised of {$\approx$} 20-40\% of organic material of terrestrial origin. These estimates are as high as, or higher than, prior measures obtained by experimentally manipulating the inorganic (13)C content of these lakes to augment the small, natural contrast in (13)C between terrestrial and algal photosynthesis. Our study gives credence to a growing literature, which we review here, suggesting that significant terrestrial support of pelagic crustaceans (zooplankton) is widespread.},

A DCM can either be a phytoplankton (carbon) biomass maximum (Deep Biomass Maximum, DBM), or the consequence of photoacclimation processes (Deep photoAcclimation Maximum, DAM) resulting in the increase of chlorophyll a per phytoplankton carbon. Even though these DCM (further qualified as either DBMs or DAMs) have long been studied, no global-scale assessment has yet been undertaken and large knowledge gaps still remain in relation to the environmental drivers responsible for their formation and maintenance. In order to investigate their spatial and temporal variability in the open ocean, we use a global data set acquired by more than 500 Biogeochemical-Argo floats given that DCMs can be detected from the comparative vertical distribution of chlorophyll a concentrations and particulate backscattering coefficients. Our findings show that the seasonal dynamics of the DCMs are clearly region-dependent. High-latitude environments are characterized by a low occurrence of intense DBMs, restricted to summer. Meanwhile, oligotrophic regions host permanent DAMs, occasionally replaced by DBMs in summer, while subequatorial waters are characterized by permanent DBMs benefiting from favorable conditions in terms of both light and nutrients. Overall, the appearance and depth of DCMs are primarily driven by light attenuation in the upper layer. Our present assessment of DCM occurrence and of environmental conditions prevailing in their development lay the basis for a better understanding and quantification of their role in carbon budgets (primary production and export).},

Seven of the thirteen components were identified as quinone-like based on comparison of their excitation and emission spectra to spectra of model quinones. These quinone-like fluorophores were found to vary in redox state and degree of conjugation. Two components were identified as amino acid-like based on comparison to tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence spectra. The other four components are not yet associated with any class of molecules. The quinone-like fluorophores account for about 50\% of the fluorescence for every sample analyzed, showing that quinone-like fluorophores are an important and ubiquitous fluorescing moiety and in natural waters. Further, the distribution of the quinone-like fluorophores was evaluated as a function of environmental and laboratory redox gradients. Under reducing conditions, the contribution of the reduced quinone-like fluorophores increased concurrent with a decrease in the oxidized quinone-like fluorophores, indicating that DOM fluorescence is a function of redox state of quinone-like moieties. Lastly, a ratio of two quinone-like fluorophores was found to explain the variation in the fluorescence index. These results provide new insight into the redox reactivity of DOM and have implications for the application of fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool to characterize DOM.},

Only in the year in which environmental variables were unimportant did connectivity between the ponds influence species richness. 4. These results suggest that local environmental variables related to the clearwater/turbid state alternative equilibria in shallow lakes are important in determining cladoceran species richness. Connectivity and dispersal of individuals between the different ponds only act secondarily by increasing the general species richness within a pond through dispersal from ponds with different environmental conditions.},

We found that utilization of even simple low-molecular-weight DOM components by bacteria differed across the major phylogenetic groups and often did not correlate with the relative abundance of these bacterial groups in estuarine and coastal environments. The Cytophaga-Flavobacter cluster was overrepresented in the portion of the assemblage consuming chitin, N-acetylglucosamine, and protein but was generally underrepresented in the assemblage consuming amino acids. The amino acid-consuming assemblage was usually dominated by the alpha subclass of the class Proteobacteria, although the representation of alpha-proteobacteria in the protein-consuming assemblages was about that expected from their relative abundance in the entire bacterial community. In our experiments, no phylogenetic group dominated the consumption of all DOM, suggesting that the participation of a diverse assemblage of bacteria is essential for the complete degradation of complex DOM in the oceans.

In terms of bottom-up control, modifying the phytoplankton distribution will ultimately affect the entire food web and carbon export. However, detecting and quantifying changes in phytoplankton communities in the Arctic Ocean remains difficult because of the lack of data and the inconsistent identification methods used. Based on pigment and microscopy data sampled in the Beaufort Sea during summer 2009, we optimized the chemotaxonomic tool CHEMTAX (CHEMical TAXonomy) for the assessment of phytoplankton community composition in an Arctic setting. The geographical distribution of the main phytoplankton groups was determined with clustering methods. Four phytoplankton assemblages were determined and related to bathymetry, nutrients and light availability. Surface waters across the whole survey region were dominated by prasinophytes and chlorophytes, whereas the subsurface chlorophyll maximum was dominated by the centric diatoms Chaetoceros socialis on the shelf and by two populations of nanoflagellates in the deep basin. Microscopic counts showed a high contribution of the heterotrophic dinoflagellates Gymnodinium and Gyrodinium spp. to total carbon biomass, suggesting high grazing activity at this time of the year. However, CHEMTAX was unable to detect these dinoflagellates because they lack peridinin. In heterotrophic dinoflagellates, the inclusion of the pigments of their prey potentially leads to incorrect group assignments and some misinterpretation of CHEMTAX. Thanks to the high reproducibility of pigment analysis, our results can serve as a baseline to assess change and spatial or temporal variability in several phytoplankton populations that are not affected by these misinterpretations.},

Eight experiments were done in the Norwegian Sea during May and June 2008. The growth-limiting factor (carbon or mineral nutrient) for heterotrophic bacteria was inferred from the combination of nutrient additions that stimulated highest bacterial oxygen consumption, biomass, produc- tion, growth rate and bacterial efficiency. We conclude that heterotrophic bacteria were limited by organic carbon and co-limited by mineral nutrients during the prevailing early nano-phytoplankton (1\textendash 10 lm) bloom conditions. High nucleic acid (HNA) bacteria became dominant ([80\%) only when labile carbon and mineral nutrient sources were available. Changes in bacterial community structure were investigated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes. The bacterial community structure changed during incubation time, but neither car- bon nor mineral nutrient amendment induced changes at the end of the experiments. The lack of labile organic carbon and the availability of mineral nutrients are key factors controlling bacterial activity and the role of the microbial food web in carbon sequestration},

  abstract = {The responses of phytoplankton to turbulent motions in the surface mixed layer can be measured to estimate the rate of vertical mixing. If the time scale for the response (photoadaptation) is shorter than that for vertical mixing, phytoplankton will exhibit a vertical gradient associated with adaptation to ambient light, whereas if mixing occurs with a time scale shorter than that of photoadaptation, the surface mixed layer will be uniform with respect to the photoadaptive parameter. To examine the physiological bases for a model of vertical mixing and photoadaptation, we grew the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana (clone 3H) at three photon flux densities and subjected the cultures to reciprocal light shifts, measuring physiological and chemical changes over the following 10 h. Several parameters, easily measured in nature and attributable primarily to phytoplankton, responded to fluctuating light on different time scales. After cultures were exposed to relatively bright light, both the initial slope of the photosynthesis-irradiance curve and in vivo fluorescence were depressed on a time scale of less than an hour. Photosynthetic capacity was also reduced transiently, but recovered over many hours to a high level characteristic of an adapted state. First-order kinetics (the current model of choice for describing photoadaptation) reasonably described the rapid responses of phytoplankton to bright light, but other parameters (i.e. cellular chemical composition and photosynthetic capacity) changed as a result of unbalanced growth and required much longer to adapt from low to high light as compared to from high to low light. A logistic model of this adaptation is presented. The model suggests that hysteresis of adaptation during vertical mixing may have important consequences. The vertical distributions of photoadaptive properties in mixed layers not only reveal the rate of vertical mixing, but show how phytoplankton integrate environmental fluctuations.},

Mechanisms that contribute to the formation and maintenance of the SCMLs include a local maximum in phytoplankton growth rate near the nutricline, photoacclimation of pigment content that leads to elevated Chl relative to phytoplankton biomass at depth, and a range of physiologically influenced swimming behaviors in motile phytoplankton and buoyancy control in diatoms and cyanobacteria that can lead to aggregations of phytoplankton in layers, subject to grazing and physical control. A postulated typical stable water structure characterizes consistent patterns in vertical profiles of Chl, phytoplankton biomass, nutrients, and light across a trophic gradient structured by the vertical flux of nutrients and characterized by the average daily irradiance at the nutricline. Hypothetical predictions can be tested using a nascent biogeochemical global ocean observing system. Partial results to date are generally consistent with predictions based on current knowledge, which has strong roots in research from the twentieth century.},

  abstract = {This study investigates trends in the timing and magnitude of seasonal maximum flood events across Canada. A new methodology for analyzing trends in the timing of flood events is developed that takes into account the directional character and multi-modality of flood occurrences. The methodology transforms the directional series of flood occurrences into new series by defining a new location of the origin. A test of flood seasonality (multi-modality) is then applied to identify dominant flood seasons. Floods from the dominant seasons are analyzed separately by a seasonal trend analysis. The Mann-Kendall test in conjunction with the method of pre-whitening is used in the trend analysis. Over 160 streamflow records from one common observation period are analyzed in watersheds with relatively pristine and stable land-use conditions. The results show weak signals of climate variability and/or change present in the timing of floods in Canada during the last three decades. Most of the significant trends in the timing of spring snowmelt floods are negative trends (earlier flood occurrence) found in the southern part of Canada. There are no significant trends identified in the timing of fall rainfall floods. However, the significance of the fall, rainfall-dominated flood season has been increasing in several analyzed watersheds. This may indicate increasing intensity of rainfall events during the recent years. Trends in the magnitude of floods are more pronounced than the trends in the timing of floods. Almost one fifth of all the analyzed stations show significant trends in the magnitude of snowmelt floods. Most of the significant trends are negative trends, suggesting decreasing magnitudes of snowmelt floods in Canada over the last three decades. Significant negative trends are found particularly in southern Ontario, northern Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. There are no significant trends in the magnitude of rainfall floods found in the analyzed streamflow records. The results support the outcomes of previous streamflow trend studies conducted in Canada. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Its polyelectrolytic and heterogeneous characters make it an effective metal-complexing agent with highly diverse characteristics. Microbes utilize DOM as a source of nutrients and energy and their enzymatic activity may change its composition, thereby altering the bioavailability and toxicity of metals. This study investigated the impacts of microbial inoculation upon the optical and copper-binding properties of freshly produced leaf-litter leachate over 168 h. Copper speciation was measured using voltammetry, and using fluorescence quenching analysis of independent fluorophores determined using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Two protein/polyphenol-like and two fulvic/humic-like components were detected. Thirty-five percent of total protein/polyphenol-like fluorescence was removed after 168-h of exposure to riverine microbes. The microbial humic-like and tryptophan-like PARAFAC components retained significantly different log K values after 168 h of incubation (p {$<$} 0.05), while their complexing capacities were similar. Using voltammetry, a sixfold increase in copper-complexing capacity (CC, from 130 to 770 {$\mu$}mol Cu g C(-1)) was observed over the exposure period, while the conditional binding constant (log K) decreased from 7.2 to 5.8. Overall binding parameters determined using voltammetry and fluorescence quenching were in agreement. However, the electrochemically based binding strength was significantly greater than that exhibited by any of the PARAFAC components, which may be due to the impact of non-fluorescent DOM, or differences in the concentration ranges of metals analyzed (i.e., different analytical windows). It was concluded that the microbial metabolization of maple leaf leachate has a significant impact upon DOM composition and its copper-binding characteristics.},

Fish composition also reflects aquatic macrophyte communities, which provide them with critical habitat. Although investigators have shown that the relationship between water quality and fish community structure can be used to indicate wetland health, we speculate that this relationship is a result of the stronger, more direct relationship between water quality and macrophytes, together with the ensuing interconnection between macrophyte and fish assemblages. In this study, we use data collected from 115 Great Lakes coastal marshes to test the hypothesis that plants are better predictors of fish species composition than is water quality. First we use canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to conduct an ordination of the fish community constrained by water quality parameters. We then use co-correspondence analysis (COCA) to conduct a direct ordination of the fish community with the plant community data. By comparing the statistic `percent fit,' which refers to the cumulative percentage variance of the species data, we show that plants are consistently better predictors of the fish community than are water quality variables in three separate trials: all wetlands in the Great Lakes basin (whole: 21.2\% vs 14.0\%; n=60), all wetlands in Lakes Huron and Superior (Upper: 20.3\% vs 18.8\%; n=32), and all wetlands in Georgian Bay and the North Channel (Georgian Bay: 18\% vs 17\%; n=70).

Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called `early warning signals', and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data.},

Water from 3 Swedish lakes (humic, oligotrophic clearwater, eutrophic) was exposed to low light or kept in total darkness in triplicate 100 1 cylinders. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics, bacterial growth and biomass of protozoans, rotifers and microcrustaceans were followed over 18 mo. In the dark treatments, no primary production was detected and DOC concentrations decreased by between 19 and 27\% (1.3 to 3.2 mg C l(-1)). There was bacterial and protozoan growth in the dark during the whole experimental period. However, numbers and production of bacteria, as well as protozoan biomass, were significantly lower in darkness. Dissolved (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) initially present in the water (i.e. 18 mo old at the end of the experiment) helped to support substantial metazoan biomasses in dark treatments in the humic and eutrophic waters, but not in the oligotrophic clearwater lake. DOM in the humic water, thus largely of allochthonous origin, gave the highest and most prolonged support to zooplankton living in darkness. Our study indicates that a microbial food web, based on allochthonous organic matter and developing independently from phytoplankton, can act as a link to metazoan zooplankton, especially in oligotrophic humic lakes. These results confirm studies using stable C isotopes, showing a substantial incorporation of terrestrial carbon into zooplankton.},

For the eutrophic water, there were no significant differences in proto- or metazooplankton biomasses between microcosms receiving UV-exposed or nonexposed DOM. Differences between eutrophic water microcosms were not significant when flagellates, ciliates, cladocerans, and copepods were examined separately. In microcosms with UV-exposed humic water, biomasses of heterotrophic flagellates, rotifers, nauplii, and cladocerans were higher than in those with nonexposed DOM. Higher final metazooplankton biomass following addition of UV-exposed humic water indicates that photochemically modified DOM can be effectively transferred through the microbial loop.},

In this study, long-term (1 yr) incubation experiments in fresh- and sea-waters were done with glucose as the only source of carbon for microorganisms. Bulk carbon, glucose and amino acid enantiomers analyses confirmed that glucose was transformed into microbial biomass and complex non-labile DOM. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations decreased during the first four months and then remained constant at {\~ }20\% of the initial level. After one year, the microbial DOM and DOM from natural waters were concentrated by evaporation and a low volume solid-phase extraction (SPE) that resulted in a very high (70 to 85\%) extraction efficiency. These SPE-DOM samples were characterized by size-exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC) coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). These are the first HPLC-SEC-FTIR analyses of microbial DOM and of such high proportions of natural DOM. Results revealed that microbial DOM showed all the FTIR absorption bands seen in the DOM from natural waters. However, amino acids, carbohydrates, and aliphatic CH were more abundant in the microbial DOM, whereas phenols and esters were more visible in DOM from natural waters. It was difficult to identify consistent (in all samples) compositional trends according to molecular weight (MW). Cluster analyses showed that 72\% of the variability in the relative absorbance for all the bands was explained by the origin and the type of the DOM extracts. The microbial DOM from freshwater had the most unique bulk composition while the microbial DOM from seawater was more similar to the DOM from natural waters. The DOM from natural fresh- and sea-waters exhibited the most similar composition when all the bands and MW are considered. The lack of consistent trends in the composition of the samples having the same origin (e.g., the two microbial DOM or the two freshwater DOM) shows the high heterogeneity and complexity of DOM, including the microbial non-labile DOM produced by the MCP. This suggests that the MCP contributes to the heterogeneity and complexity of the DOM found in natural waters.},

  abstract = {We defined mesozooplankton biogeography in the North American Arctic to elucidate drivers of biodiversity, community structure, and biomass of this key component of the Arctic marine ecosystem. A multivariate analysis identified four mesozooplankton assemblages: Arctic-oceanic, Arctic-shelf, Coastal-Hudson, and Labrador Sea. Bathymetry was a major driver of the distribution of these assemblages. In shallow waters, Cirripedia and the copepod Pseudocalanus spp. dominated the Coastal-Hudson and Arctic-shelf assemblages, which showed low species richness (19) and biomass (0.28 and 1.49 g C m-2, respectively). The Arctic-oceanic assemblage occupied the entire North American Arctic, except for shallow breaks in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago downstream of sills blocking the Atlantic Water layer circulation below a depth of 200 m. This assemblage showed high copepod biomass (4.74 g C m-2) with a high share of Calanus hyperboreus, C. glacialis, and Metridia longa. In habitats below 200-m depth, C. hyperboreus represented 68\% of the copepod biomass, underscoring its role as a keystone species in this ecosystem. Strong numerical representation by the boreal-Atlantic C. finmarchicus and Oithona atlantica stressed the strong Atlantic influence on the subarctic Labrador Sea assemblage on the northwestern Labrador Sea slope. The mixed Arctic-Atlantic composition of the Labrador Sea mesozooplankton resulted in high species richness (58) and biomass (5.73 g C m-2). The low abundance of Atlantic and Pacific taxa in the areas influenced by Arctic currents did not alter the Arctic status of the Arctic-oceanic, Arctic-shelf, and Coastal-Hudson assemblages. This study identifies hotspots of mesozooplankton biomass and diversity in Central Amundsen Gulf, Lancaster Sound, North Water Polynya and Baffin Bay, known for their high biological productivity and concentrations of vertebrate predators.

Ice-associated fauna play a key role in this context because they constitute a unique part of Arctic biodiversity and transmit carbon from sea-ice algae into pelagic and benthic food webs. Our study presents the first regional-scale record of under-ice faunal distribution and the environmental characteristics of under-ice habitats throughout the Eurasian Basin. Sampling was conducted with a Surface and Under-Ice Trawl, equipped with a sensor array recording ice thickness and other physical parameters during trawling. We identified 2 environmental regimes, broadly coherent with the Nansen and Amundsen Basins. The Nansen Basin regime was distinguished from the Amundsen Basin regime by heavier sea-ice conditions, higher surface salinities and higher nitrate + nitrite concentrations. We found a diverse (28 species) under-ice community throughout the Eurasian Basin. Change in community structure reflected differences in the relative contribution of abundant species. Copepods (Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis) dominated in the Nansen Basin regime. In the Amundsen Basin regime, amphipods (Apherusa glacialis, Themisto libellula) dominated. Polar cod Boreogadus saida was present throughout the sampling area. Abrupt changes from a dominance of ice-associated amphipods at ice-covered stations to a dominance of pelagic amphipods (T. libellula) at nearby ice-free stations emphasised the decisive influence of sea ice on small-scale patterns in the surface-layer community. The observed response in community composition to different environmental regimes indicates potential long-term alterations in Arctic marine ecosystems as the Arctic Ocean continues to change.},

The optical characteristics of the CDOM in the Orinoco River plume were investigated during two cruises to the eastern Caribbean using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. We found that high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and abundance of CDOM in the eastern Caribbean were related to the Orinoco River plume. We did not observe changes in optical properties of CDOM in waters with salinities lower than 30. Self-shading from sunlight and the preponderance of riverine material at these low salinities can explain the observed behavior. Changes in the optical properties of the CDOM were observed in stations with salinities higher than 30 and were related to mixing between riverine and marine end-members, and to photodegradation. Light penetration and, consequently, the position of the chlorophyll maxima in areas close to the Gulf of Paria were controlled by the concentration of CDOM. Of the two main fluorophores found in this study, only the humic fluorophore appeared to be related to the absorption of light by CDOM in the visible spectrum. A secondary fluorophore, with excitation and emission in the UV, appeared to be resistant to photodegradation and did not show any relationship with absorbance in the visible range.},

Fluorescence spectroscopy results showed that optical properties of riverine CDOM were lost close to the mouth of the rivers. A simple mathematical model describing mixing between riverine and marine end-members demonstrated that most of the observed changes in optical properties of CDOM along salinity gradients can be explained by mixing.

From 2000 to 2005 we recorded surface measurements of DOC, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), salinity, and water-leaving radiances during five cruises to the Mississippi River Plume. These measurements were used to develop empirical relationships to derive DOC, CDOM, and salinity from monthly composites of SeaWiFS imagery collected from 1998 through 2005. We compared our remote sensing estimates of river flow and DOC transport with data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from 1998 through 2005. Our remote sensing estimates of river flow and DOC transport correlated well (r2 ??? 0.70) with the USGS data. Our remote sensing estimates and USGS field data showed low variability in DOC concentrations in the river end-member (7-11\%), and high seasonal variability in river flow (??? 50\%). Therefore, changes in river flow control the variability in DOC transport, indicating that the remote sensing estimate of river flow is the most critical element of our DOC transport measurement. We concluded that it is possible to use this method to estimate DOC transport by other large rivers if there are data on the relationship between CDOM, DOC, and salinity in the river plume. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Because the biomasses of both autotrophs and heterotrophs can be estimated with relative ease and because workers use similar techniques, data are available from a wide range of lakes. Both literature data, representing a wide geographical range, and data from a localized set of lakes show that the ratio of heterotrophic to autotrophic biomass (H/A ratio) is well above unity where autotrophic biomass is low and declines where autotrophic biomass is high. A similar pattern is found in marine and terrestrial systems. In terrestrial systems, this pattern has been explained by changes in the turnover time of the autotrophic biomass, but in lakes energetic subsidies from the littoral and the watershed are likely needed to support the relatively high heterotrophic biomass of many oligotrophic systems.},

These estimates of carbon flow through bacteria are conservative, however, because losses due to bacterial respiration are seldom directly measured(4,5). We report here that bacterial respiration is generally high, and tends to exceed phytoplankton net production in unproductive systems (less than 70 to 120 mu g carbon per litre per day). A large proportion of the world's aquatic systems have phytoplankton productivities below this value(6). Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) is the result of BP and BR[BGE = BP/(BR + BP)]. Comparisons of our models of bacterial respiration with published models of bacterial secondary production(1,7) show that bacterial growth efficiency must range fi om less than 10\% to 25\% in most freshwater and marine systems, well below the values commonly assumed in many current ecological models(1,2,8,9). The imbalance between bacterial respiration and phytoplankton production suggests that in unproductive aquatic systems, the biological system is a net source of CO2.},

  abstract = {Heterotrophic bacteria perform two major functions in the transformation of organic matter: They produce new bacterial biomass (bacterial secondary production [BP]), and they respire organic C to inorganic C (bacterial respiration [BR]). For planktonic bacteria, a great deal has been learned about BP and its regulation during the past several decades but far less has been learned about BR. Our lack of knowledge about BR limits our ability to understand the role of bacteria in the carbon cycle of aquatic ecosystems. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) is the amount of new bacterial biomass produced per unit of organic C substrate assimilated and is a way to relate BP and BR: BGE = (BP)/(BP + BR). Estimates of BGE for natural planktonic bacteria range from {$<$}0.05 to as high as 0.6, but little is known about what might regulate this enormous range. In this paper we review the physiological and ecological bases of the regulation of BGE. Further, we assemble the literature of the past 30 years for which both BP and BR were measured in natural planktonic ecosystems and explore the relationship between BGE and BP. Although the relationship is variable, BGE varies systematically with BP and the trophic richness of the ecosystem. In the most dilute, oligotrophic systems, BGE is as low as 0.01; in the most eutrophic systems, it plateaus near 0.5. Planktonic bacteria appear to maximize carbon utilization rather than BGE. A consequence of this strategy is that maintenance energy costs (and therefore maintenance respiration) seems to be highest in oligotrophic systems.},

  abstract = {Bacterial respiration (BR) of organic matter is an important flux in the carbon budgets of large rivers, yet the regulation of BR and the relationship of this respiration to various organic matter sources is poorly understood. Using detailed spatial transects, we evaluated transport and consumption of dissolved organic matter in the Hudson River estuary, and compared both with BR. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, long-term DOC lability, and in situ BR were measured at 24 stations on each of five transects. DOC lability, measured in long-term bioassays, averaged 15 mu g L-1 d(-1) and was similar to the average net rate of decline of DOC from the upper to lower estuary. BR averaged 156 mu g L-1 d(-1) C, far exceeding the net downriver DOC decline and measured DOC lability. BR was well predicted by a model that included seston, chlorophyll, and DOC consumption. Rate coefficients derived from this model indicate that BR is primarily supported by carbon derived from seston and chlorophyll. Changes in DOC concentration along the Hudson flow path were well predicted from a combination of freshwater input, DOC concentration in the headwaters, and long-term DOC lability. Although most of the total respiration is due to free-living bacteria and thus mediated by DOC, {$<$}20\% of this respiration is actually supported by DOC loaded in the headwaters, and transported downstream. The Hudson River, therefore, acts as a pipe transporting dissolved terrestrial organic matter seaward while also functioning as a reactor where intense bacterial activity degrades organic matter associated primarily with particles or generated locally.},

  abstract = {The organic carbon consumed by aquatic bacteria (BCC) is partitioned between bacterial production (BP) and respiration (BR), but the factors that determine BCC and its partition into BP and BR are not well understood. We explored the coupling between BR, BR and BCC, and their links to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient availability in natural and restored tidal marshes and in the adjoining waters of Delaware Bay estuary. Labile DOC (LDOC) ranged from 3\% to 22\% of the DOC pool, and explained more of the variance in both BR and BCC than did bulk DOC. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) was highly variable (0.09-0.58), and natural Spartina alterniflora marshes had consistently higher BGE than both restoration marshes and tidal floodwaters. BGE was negatively related to the ratio of LDOC to total dissolved phosphorous, which was highest in natural marshes. The enhancement of BP observed in the marshes relative to the estuarine floodwaters had different origins: In natural marshes it was mostly due to increases in BGE, whereas in restored marshes it followed increased BCC. These results highlight the importance of P in regulating microbial metabolism in coastal areas, and the need to understand the pathways that lead to BP in these systems.},

  abstract = {The effects of monochromatic and polychromatic UV and visible (VIS) radiation on the optical properties (absorption and fluorescence) of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were examined for a Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) standard and for water from the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. The primary (direct) loss of absorption and fluorescence occurred at the irradiation wavelength(s), with smaller secondary (indirect) losses occurring outside the irradiation wavelength(s). The efficiency of both direct and indirect photobleaching decreased monotonically with increasing wavelength. Exposure to polychromatic light increased the CDOM absorption spectral slope (S), consistent with previous field measurements. An analysis of the monochromatic photobleaching kinetics argues that a model based on a simple superposition of multiple chromophores undergoing independent photobleaching cannot apply; this conclusion further implies that the absorption spectrum of CDOM cannot arise solely from a simple superposition of the spectra of numerous independent chromophores. The kinetics of CDOM absorption loss with the monochromatic irradiation were employed to create a simple, heuristic model of photobleaching. This model allowed us to examine the importance of the indirect photobleaching losses in determining the overall photobleaching rates as well as to model the photobleaching of natural waters under polychromatic light fields. Application of this model to natural waters closely predicted the change in the CDOM spectral shape caused by photodegradation. The time scale of this process was consistent with field observations acquired during the summertime for coastal waters in the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). The results indicate that the ratio of the photodegradation depth to the mixed layer depth is a key parameter controlling the rate of the photobleaching in surface waters. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The studied lakes were selected because of their position at opposite ends of a surface connectivity gradient. Los Matadores Lake, with high connectivity, has a direct connection to the river via a short channel that is active during a large part of the year. At the other extreme, the low connectivity El Tigre Lake has an indirect connection to the river through a swampy area that is only active for short periods. During ordinary hydrologic periods, zooplankton abundance and species richness appear to be controlled by the degree of connectivity of the lakes. Abundance was higher in El Tigre, which is isolated for longer periods and consequently has a longer water-residence time. Contrary to expectations, species richness was also higher in this lake, a result that was surprising because water bodies with low conectivity/disturbance are predicted to have a lower biodiversity. This unexpected outcome reflects the nature of the connecting route, which crosses a long and complex swampy ecotone.},

Vertical profiles describe the distribution of gelbstoff and of tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like molecules. These are compared with hydrographic data. Gelbstoff fluorescence is low near the sea surface due to photodegradation. Except for enhanced values at 300-500 m depth at some stations, Gelbstoff fluorescence is almost constant in intermediate (Mediterranean Water, Antarctic Intermediate Water) and deep waters (North Atlantic Deep Water) despite the very different origins of these water masses. In contrast to gelbstoff, tryptophan- and tyrosine-like signals are highest near the sea surface. Particulate organic matter and derived dissolved organic molecules are discussed as possible sources of these fluorophores. In the upper portion of the main thermocline, where the gelbstoff is greater than deeper in the water column, the fluorescence signals of gelbstoff and tryptophan-like molecules covary. This supports the assumption that decomposition of sinking particles, and increased concentrations of bacteria due to this process, contribute to the vertical distribution of fluorescent matter at these depths.

Lake Michigan presents an interesting scenario for yellow perch (Perca flavescens), a species with a long pelagic larval stage that may not be well adapted to lakes with an expansive pelagic environment and extensive offshore transport. We investigated the possibility that early life stages of yellow perch were transported well offshore from their nearshore spawning grounds and explored whether food resources were more or less favorable offshore. To determine the extent to which pelagic age-0 yellow perch moved offshore, we sampled at multiple scales ranging from local ({$<$} 2 km) to across the lake ({$>$} 120 km). Evidence of offshore movement by fish larvae occurred at each scale. Yellow perch larvae were quickly transported offshore from nearshore spawning sites and remained in the offshore pelagia to sizes of at least 30 mm. Zooplankton density was greater offshore than nearshore, suggesting that pelagic age-0 yellow perch find improved food resources offshore compared with their nearshore spawning sites. Currents operating at oceanographic scales likely influenced the offshore movement of pelagic age-0 yellow perch in Lake Michigan. These currents, coupled with prey availability for pelagic age-0 individuals, may influence the recruitment success of this species.},

The model relates the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton to chlorophyll-a concentration, assuming that the assemblages of phytoplankton comprise mixtures of two populations whose proportions vary as the total concentration of cells changes. The model is applied to in situ data collected from six regions during 34 cruises. The model compares well with earlier models of phytoplankton absorption but brings the additional advantage of parameters that have clear bio-optical and biological interpretation. Size structure of the phytoplankton populations was inferred from the values of the specific absorption coefficients. The results are consistent with pigment analyses performed on the same samples. Seasonal analysis of data from the northwest Atlantic, southeast Pacific, and the Arabian Sea showed significant changes in the spectral form and magnitude of the specific absorption coefficients of small- and large-celled populations, which appear to be related to changes in species composition. The model serves thus as an optical tool to explore the large-scale biogeography of phytoplankton. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Interpreting the relationships between gas exchange and biological activity measured in these expeditions is facilitated if the water masses sampled can be identified in a large-scale context. Longhurst et al. (1995) tackled the issue of water mass characterisation by defining biogeochemical provinces for the world ocean and in particular for the NW Atlantic. To avoid the limitations that arise from the static arrangement of provinces with rectilinear boundaries as used in Longhurst et al. (1995), we developed a dynamic method based on statistical analysis of geophysical and biological data to delineate the boundaries of Longhurst's provinces in real time. This new method was applied to satellite-retrieved sea-surface temperature (SST) and phytoplankton biomass data averaged over the length of the research cruises (22, 17 and 16 d in spring, summer and fall respectively). CTD casts at various stations along the ship track were used to validate the method. A sensitivity study on primary production estimations performed with both definitions (static and dynamic) showed a negligible difference at the basin scale; however, variations at the province scale were significant. The regional description afforded by the new method was useful for the interpretation of expedition data. \textcopyright{} Inter-Research 2007.},

We found significant differences in the spatiotemporal variations of the bio-optical properties for three oceanic regimes: mesotrophic (Scotian Shelf), oligotrophic (Northwest Atlantic Basin, NAB), and subartic (Labrador Sea). The Scotian Shelf and NAB exhibited similar phenology with the spring and autumn blooms associated with low phytoplankton specific absorption, while only relatively high fucoxanthin concentration occurred in spring. The NAB showed a smaller seasonal variation than the Scotian Shelf in agreement with its oceanic conditions. The Labrador Sea showed a single phytoplankton bloom in spring followed by a continuous decrease in biomass the rest of the year. The relationship between phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 443 nm and chlorophyll-a concentration was consistent with other studies with coefficients that were region-dependent. Absorption by non-algal particulate matter remained between 5\% and 60\% of phytoplankton absorption with a mean of 15\%. The slope of the non-algal particulate absorption varied with seasons and regions and appeared to depend on the trophic status with high values (i.e., up to 0.04) occurring during bloom conditions. We also introduced a new index, the phytoplankton apparent absorption wavelength (               PAAW               ), a wavelength-weighted sum of absorption expressed in nanometers that provides information on the phytoplankton biomass and assemblage in a simple manner.

  abstract = {In population models, omnivorous predation (i.e., predation on {$>$} 1 trophic level) generally has a destabilizing influence, whereas habitat heterogeneity tends to stabilize both predatory and competitive interactions. I experimentally evaluated the impact of a native omnivorous predator and of habitat structural complexity on the structure of a freshwater littoral macroinvertebrate community. Perch (Percafluviatilis) were stocked at three densities (no fish, and low and high natural densities) into pond enclosures with dense submerged vegetation present or absent. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, size struc- ture, and diversity as well as gut contents of perch were monitored over a 2-mo summer period. Perch consumed both predatory and nonpredatory invertebrates except molluscs. In vegetation, perch consumed macroinvertebrates almost exclusively during the whole ex- periment, whereas in the absence of vegetation, perch successively increased their con- sumption of microcrustaceans. The biomass of predatory invertebrates and the abundance of the dominant predatory invertebrate Sialis lutaria (Insecta: Megaloptera) decreased with increasing perch density in both vegetation treatments. In contrast, perch density had no effect on the biomass of nonmolluscan herbivores and detritivores. Vegetation increased the biomass of all macroinvertebrates and tended to delay the negative effect of perch on predatory invertebrates. Perch density had a negative effect on the mean size of total nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates, but not of predatory invertebrates and nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores considered separately. While perch density had an effect on the diversity (Shannon evenness and Shannon diversity) of only nonmolluscan macroinver- tebrates (i.e., potential prey), vegetation had a positive effect on species richness (but not on evenness) of all macroinvertebrates. The results suggest that perch disproportionally preyed on predatory invertebrates, but that characteristics other than size per se were responsible for their higher vulnerability to perch. Perch may have affected nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores simultaneously through direct consumption and through indirect release from invertebrate predation, which could explain the lack of a perch effect on nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores. Complex in- teractions between the omnivorous predator, intermediate consumers, and resource species (macroinvertebrate herbivores and detritivores) may explain the relationship between perch density and macroinvertebrate diversity. The reduction in foraging efficiency of perch in submerged vegetation, and the observed diet shift of perch towards microcrustaceans when predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates can coexist with fish in the littoral of lakes to a higher extent than in the pelagic zone. Predatory invertebrates may thus play a more important role in food web dynamics of littoral than of pelagic communities},

We present seasonal time series data of chlorophyll a, primary productivity and in-water irradiance measured in the coastal waters of the Western Antarctica Peninsula and build upon existing models to provide a more optimum parameterization for the estimation of primary productivity in Antarctic coastal waters. These and other data provide strong evidence that bio-optical characteristics and phytoplankton productivity in Antarctic waters an different from temperate waters. For these waters we show that over 60\% of the variability in primary production can be explained by the surface chlorophyll a concentration alone, a characteristic, which lends itself to remote sensing models. if chlorophyll a concentrations are accurately determined, then the largest source of error 13-18) results from estimates of the photoadaptive variable (P-opt(B)). Further, the overall magnitude of P-opt(B) is low (median 1.09 mg C mg chl(-1) h(-1)) for these data compared to other regions and generally fits that expected for a cold water system. However, the variability of P-opt(B) over the course of a season (0.4 to 3 mg C mg chl(-1) h(-1)) is not consistently correlated with other possible environmental parameters, such as chlorophyll, sea surface temperature, incident irradiance, day length, salinity, or taxonomic composition. Nonetheless, by tuning a standard depth- integrated primary productivity model to fit representative P-opt(B) values and the relatively uniform chlorophyll-normalized production profile found in these waters, we can improve the model to account for approximately 72-73\% variability in primary production both for our data as well as for independent historic Antarctic data.},

Plant growth form influenced prey capture rates more than charges in natural plant density. Plant density effects ranged from none on damselfly capture rates to a 29\% decline in cladoceran capture rate over a twofold increase in plant density.

  abstract = {Earth's volatile elements (H, C, and N) are essential to maintaining habitable conditions for metazoans and simpler life forms. However, identifying the sources (comets, meteorites, and trapped nebular gas) that supplied volatiles to Earth is not straightforward because secondary processes like mantle degassing, crustal recycling, and escape to space modified the composition of the atmosphere. Here, we review two complementary approaches to investigate the origin of Earth's atmosphere and oceans. The geochemical approach uses volatile element abundances and isotopic compositions to identify the possible contributors to the atmosphere and to disentangle the processes that shaped it. In that respect, noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe), elements that are chemically inert and possess several isotopes produced by radioactivity, play a critical role. The dynamical approach uses our knowledge of planetary dynamics to track volatile delivery to the Earth, starting with dust transport in the disk to planet-building processes. The main conclusion is that Earth acquired most of its major volatile elements by accretion of planetesimals or embryos akin to volatile-rich meteorites. At the same time, solar/meteoritic noble gases were captured by embryos and some gases were lost to space, by hydrodynamic escape and large impacts. Comets did not contribute much H, C, and N but may have delivered significant noble gases, which could represent the only fingerprints of the bombardment of our planet with icy bodies. The processes that governed the delivery of volatile elements to the Earth are thought to be relatively common and it is likely that Earth-like planets covered with oceans exist in extra-solar systems.},

  abstract = {Periphyton and macrophytes alter water velocity in streams, influencing movement of solutes and providing microhabitat for other organisms. How assemblages with different growth form and architecture influence water velocity attenuation across mm to dm scales is not well described. A thermistor microprobe was used to measure water velocity through 4 morphologically distinct stream periphyton assemblages and 4 distinct stream macrophyte assemblages in flumes, All assemblages resulted in an exponential decay in velocity with depth. A dense assemblage of diatoms (primarily Cymbella) attenuated velocity more than filamentous green algae, filamentous green algae with interspersed diatoms, or a red alga (ANOVA, p {$<$} 0.05). External water velocity had no significant influence on the coefficient of attenuation in a filamentous green alga (ANOVA, p = 0.76). Macrophytes also attenuated water velocity, but attenuation was more variable and, in all cases, attenuation coefficients were less for macrophytes than for periphyton. A model unifying attenuation by periphyton and macrophytes was developed using biomass density (g ash-free dry mass/m(3)) as the independent variable and it explained 80\% of the variation in attenuation. The relative variance of attenuation coefficients increased sharply as Reynolds number increased above similar to500 to 700, suggesting that variance in water velocity was dependent upon the spatial scale of the primary producer through which water is flowing, and that the distinction between periphyton and macrophytes may have real physical ramifications.},

Climate change significantly impacts Arctic shelf regions in terms of air temperature, ultraviolet radiation, melting of sea ice, precipitation, thawing of permafrost and coastal erosion. Direct consequences have been observed on the increasing Arctic river flow and a large amount of organic carbon sequestered in soils at high latitudes since the last glacial maximum can be expected to be delivered to the Arctic Ocean during the coming decade. Monitoring the fluxes and fate of this terrigenous organic carbon is problematic in such sparsely populated regions unless remote sensing techniques can be developed and proved to be operational. The main objective of this study is to develop an ocean colour algorithm to operationally monitor dynamics of suspended particulate matter (SPM) on the Mackenzie River continental shelf (Canadian Arctic Ocean) using satellite imagery. The water optical properties are documented across the study area and related to concentrations of SPM and particulate organic carbon (POC). Robust SPM and POC : SPM proxies are identified, such as the light backscattering and attenuation coefficients, and relationships are established between these optical and biogeochemical parameters. Following a semi-analytical approach, a regional SPM quantification relationship is obtained for the inversion of the water reflectance signal into SPM concentration. This relationship is reproduced based on independent field optical measurements. It is successfully applied to a selection of MODIS satellite data which allow estimating fluxes at the river mouth and monitoring the extension and dynamics of the Mackenzie River surface plume in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Good agreement is obtained with field observations representative of the whole water column in the river delta zone where terrigenous SPM is mainly constrained (out of short periods of maximum river outflow). Most of the seaward export of SPM is observed to occur within the west side of the river mouth. Future work will require the validation of the developed SPM regional algorithm based on match-ups with field measurements, then the routine application to ocean colour satellite data in order to better estimate the fluxes and fate of SPM and POC delivered by the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean.},

  abstract = {Global warming has a significant impact on the regional scale on the Arctic Ocean and surrounding coastal zones (i.e., Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway and Rus-sia). The recent increase in air temperature has resulted in increased precipitation along the drainage basins of Arctic rivers. It has also directly impacted land and seawater tem-peratures with the consequence of melting permafrost and sea ice. An increase in freshwater discharge by main Arctic rivers has been clearly identified in time series of field ob-servations. The freshwater discharge of the Mackenzie River has increased by 25 \% since 2003. This may have increased the mobilization and transport of various dissolved and par-ticulate substances, including organic carbon, as well as their export to the ocean. The release from land to the ocean of such organic material, which has been sequestered in a frozen state since the Last Glacial Maximum, may significantly im-pact the Arctic Ocean carbon cycle as well as marine ecosys-tems. In this study we use 11 years of ocean color satellite data and field observations collected in 2009 to estimate the mass of terrestrial suspended solids and particulate organic carbon delivered by the Mackenzie River into the Beaufort Sea (Arc-tic Ocean). Our results show that during the summer period, the concentration of suspended solids at the river mouth, in the delta zone and in the river plume has increased by 46, 71 and 33 \%, respectively, since 2003. Combined with the variations observed in the freshwater discharge, this corre-sponds to a more than 50 \% increase in the particulate (ter-restrial suspended particles and organic carbon) export from the Mackenzie River into the Beaufort Sea.},

  abstract = {An outstanding introduction to the fundamentals of regression analysis-updated and expanded The methods of regression analysis are the most widely used statistical tools for discovering the relationships among variables. This classic text, with its emphasis on clear, thorough presentation of concepts and applications, offers a complete, easily accessible introduction to the fundamentals of regression analysis. Assuming only a basic knowledge of elementary statistics, Applied Regression Analysis, Third Edition focuses on the fitting and checking of both linear and nonlinear regression models, using small and large data sets, with pocket calculators or computers. This Third Edition features separate chapters on multicollinearity, generalized linear models, mixture ingredients, geometry of regression, robust regression, and resampling procedures. Extensive support materials include sets of carefully designed exercises with full or partial solutions and a series of true/false questions with answers. All data sets used in both the text and the exercises can be found on the companion disk at the back of the book. For analysts, researchers, and students in university, industrial, and government courses on regression, this text is an excellent introduction to the subject and an efficient means of learning how to use a valuable analytical tool. It will also prove an invaluable reference resource for applied scientists and statisticians.},

  abstract = {Spatial structures of ecological communities may originate either from the dependence of community structure on environmental variables or/and from community-based processes. In order to assess the importance of these two sources, spatial relationships must be explicitly introduced into statistical models. Recently, a new approach called principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) has been proposed to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into regression or canonical analysis models, providing a flexible tool especially when contrasted to the family of autoregressive models and trend surface analysis, which are of common use in ecological and geographical analysis. In this paper, we explore the theory of the PCNM approach and demonstrate how it is linked to spatial autocorrelation structure functions. The method basically consists of diagonalizing a spatial weighting matrix, then extracting the eigenvectors that maximize the Moran's index of autocorrelation. These eigenvectors can then be used directly as explanatory variables in regression or canonical models. We propose improvements and extensions of the original method, and illustrate them with examples that will help ecologists choose the variant that will better suit their needs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {[1] In this study, we examined the temporal and spatial variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) abundance and composition in the lower Mississippi and Pearl rivers and effects of human and natural influences. In particular, we looked at bulk C/N ratio, stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta C-13) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry of high molecular weight (HMW; 0.2 mu m to 1 kDa) DOM. Monthly water samples were collected at one station in each river from August 2001 to 2003. Surveys of spatial variability of total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen ( DON) were also conducted in June 2003, from 390 km downstream in the Mississippi River and from Jackson to Stennis Space Center in the Pearl River. Higher DOC ( 336 - 1170 mu M), C/N ratio,\% aromaticity, and more depleted delta N-15 (0.76 - 2.1 parts per thousand) were observed in the Pearl than in the lower Mississippi River (223 - 380 mu M, 4.7 - 11.5 parts per thousand, respectively). DOC, C/N ratio, delta C-13, delta N-15, and \% aromaticity of Pearl River HMW DOM were correlated with water discharge, which indicated a coupling between local soil inputs and regional precipitation events. Conversely, seasonal variability in the lower Mississippi River was more controlled by spatial variability of a larger integrative signal from the watershed as well as in situ DOM processing. Spatially, very little change occurred in total DOC in the downstream survey of the lower Mississippi River, compared to a decrease of 24\% in the Pearl River. Differences in DOM between these two rivers were reflective of the Mississippi River having more extensive river processing of terrestrial DOM, more phytoplankton inputs, and greater anthropogenic perturbation than the Pearl River.},

Fish response is also scale-dependent, with some activities varying locally while others depend on large-scale connectivity within or between watersheds. These issues are still only partly recognized, with large-scale research often affected by non-independent sampling, weak inference, poor model testing or model over-extrapolation. Available multi-scale studies can reach different conclusions about factors affecting fishes from local studies, but results vary between examples. Potential explanations are (i) effects on fishes are context-dependent; (ii) different species or life-stages are limited in different ways; (iii) multi-scale studies are too few for generalization.We advocate improved use of geostatistical tools to guide sampling or interpret the spatial extent of management problems, and we illustrate this using brown trout in Welsh streams. Our strongest recommendation is that fish ecologists recognize the importance of interactions across scales in quantifying effects on fishes so that management decisions can be better based on evidence rather than judgement or extrapolation.},

Climate may operate either directly through metabolic and reproductive processes or indirectly through prey, predators, and competitors. One mechanism that may be particularly important, and which is the focus of this review, is the role of climate in affecting the reproductive success of a predator through its effect on the relative timing of food requirement and food availability during early life stages. This principle-the match or mismatch of predators' requirement with resource availability-originated in the marine literature, where it initially referred to how growth and survival of fish larvae (predator) depends on this production being synchronous with that of their main food items, i.e. early stage zooplankton (prey). Here we review how the match/mismatch hypothesis (MMH) is used to describe climate effects on ecological patterns and processes in both marine and terrestrial systems. In addition to studying match/mismatch sensu stricto, we expand on it to include effects of overall production level and the spatial aspect. Possible impacts of climate change on match/mismatch are examined in the context of one of the most apparent effects of global warming: an advancement of spring phenology. As a consequence of different species reacting dissimilarly, even minor changes in climate may invoke non-linear responses unbalancing established patterns of synchrony. All components of a food chain cannot be expected to shift their phenology at the same rate, and thus are unlikely to remain synchronous.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) assemblages have been widely used over the Arctic Ocean to reconstruct sea-surface parameters on a quantitative basis. Such reconstructions provide insights into the role of anthropogenic vs natural forcings in the actual climatic trend. Here, we present the palynological analysis of a dated 36 cm-long core collected from the Mackenzie Trough in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Dinocyst assemblages were used to quantitatively reconstruct the evolution of sea-surface conditions (temperature, salinity, sea ice) and freshwater palynomorphs fluxes were used as local paleo-river discharge indicators over the last {\~ } 150 yr. Dinocyst assemblages are dominated by autotrophic taxa (68 to 96\%). Cyst of Pentapharsodinium dalei is the dominant species throughout most of the core, except at the top where the assemblages are dominated by Operculodinium centrocarpum. Quantitative reconstructions of sea-surface parameters display a series of relatively warm, lower sea ice and saline episodes in surface waters, alternately with relatively cool and low salinity episodes. Variations of dinocyst fluxes and reconstructed sea-surface conditions may be closely linked to large scale atmospheric circulation patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and to a lesser degree, the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Positive phases of the PDO correspond to increases of dinocyst fluxes, warmer and saltier surface waters, which we associate with upwelling events of warm and relatively saline water from Pacific origin. Freshwater palynomorph fluxes increased in three phases from AD 1857 until reaching maximum values in AD 1991, suggesting that the Mackenzie River discharge followed the same trend when its discharge peaked between AD 1989 and AD 1992. The PDO mode seems to dominate the climatic variations at multi-annual to decadal timescales in the western Canadian Arctic and Beaufort Sea areas.}

We found that the CPUEw of the sum of all species increased with lake trophic status measured as chlorophyll a (r = 0.45,p {$<$} 0.009). By dissecting total fish CPUEw into individual species and functional groups, we found that only common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and benthivore CPUEw increased significantly with trophic status (p {$<$} 0.03 and 0.001, respectively). Sport fish (principally piscivores) decreased as a proportion of total CPUEw by approximately 50\%, while benthivores, primarily common carp, increased by approximately 80\% over an increase in cholorophyll a from 10 to 100 \textmu g\textperiodcentered L\textendash 1. Common carp CPUEw was correlated with and may have a negative influence on CPUEw of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) and a positive influence on white crappie (Pomoxis annularis). Our study suggests that species other than benthivores may be unable to exploit increased energy availabilityin hypereutrophic systems or are competitively excluded from using this increased production.}

  abstract = {Primary production estimates of ice algae within the bottommost layers of the Arctic ice cover are commonly derived using irradiance measurements taken immediately below the solid ice bottom. However, radiation absorbed by ice algae is significantly affected by the high-scattering sea ice environment they are embedded within because scattering increases the pathlength traveled by photons and therefore the probability of photon encounters with algal cells. Failing to account for this enhanced absorption may considerably affect estimates of the timing and magnitude of ice algal production. To demonstrate the effect of scattering and attenuation, multipliers for absorption amplification (W) and layer average opacity (x) were derived from observations of chlorophyll a concentration and the vertical attenuation coefficient over the bottom 2.5 cm of landfast sea ice. W reached values over 19 at low chlorophyll a, but became , 2 at high biomass levels, whereas x became larger as biomass levels increased. Using W to construct an apparent photosynthesis vs. irradiance relationship showed that light limitation is greatly reduced relative to the case where scattering is not considered. This highlights an important interaction not previously noted for ice algal production in their high-scattering environment. Knowledge of this absorption amplification can help explain ice algal phenology during the spring bloom and will improve ice algal production estimates and model parameterizations.},

These changes result in shifts in the sea-ice-associated (sympagic) community structure, with consequences for the sympagic food web and carbon cycling. To evaluate the role of sympagic biota as a source, sink, and transmitter of carbon, we sampled pack ice and under-ice water (0\textendash 2 m) north of Svalbard in spring 2015 by sea-ice coring and under-ice trawling. We estimated biomass and primary production of ice algae and under-ice phytoplankton as well as biomass, carbon demand, and secondary production of sea-ice meiofauna (\&gt;10 \textmu m) and under-ice fauna (\&gt;300 \textmu m). Sea-ice meiofauna biomass (0.1\textendash 2.8 mg C m\textendash 2) was dominated by harpacticoid copepods (92\%), nauplii (4\%), and Ciliophora (3\%). Under-ice fauna biomass (3.2\textendash 62.7 mg C m\textendash 2) was dominated by Calanus copepods (54\%). Appendicularia contributed 23\% through their high abundance at one station. Herbivorous sympagic fauna dominated the carbon demand across the study area, estimated at 2 mg C m\textendash 2 day\textendash 1 for ice algae and 4 mg C m\textendash 2 day\textendash 1 for phytoplankton. This demand was covered by the mean primary production of ice algae (11 mg C m\textendash 2 day\textendash 1) and phytoplankton (30 mg C m\textendash 2 day\textendash 1). Hence, potentially 35 mg C m\textendash 2 day\textendash 1 of algal material could sink from the sympagic realm to deeper layers. The demand of carnivorous under-ice fauna (0.3 mg C m\textendash 2 day\textendash 1) was barely covered by sympagic secondary production (0.3 mg C m\textendash 2 day\textendash 1). Our study emphasizes the importance of under-ice fauna for the carbon flux from sea ice to pelagic and benthic habitats and provides a baseline for future comparisons in the context of climate change.},

I studied temporal variation in the habitat distribution of perch (Perca fluviatilis) and pike (Esox lucius) in relation to habitat complexity and prey abundance in a lake. The study involved quantitative estimates of different habitat types, estimates of macroinvertebrate prey availability, and distribution and movement patterns of the fish. The numbers of 80-110 mm perch in the littoral zone decreased rapidly in spring, which was a result of either perch moving to the pelagic zone or predation mortality. Predation mortality is the most plausible explanation because piscivorous perch and pike {$>$}160 mm aggregated close to these high abundances of 80-110 mm perch, and 80-110 mm perch used only vegetated habitats as a possible protection against predators. Both the biomass and diversity of macroinvertebrates increased with vegetation density, whereas perch abundance was highest in an intermediate...},

Data were collected on temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a and zooplankton taxonomic abundances. Environmental conditions were largely related to the influence of the Mississippi River plume. The zooplankton community was numerically dominated by copepods, with various meroplankton and other non-copepod zooplankton present in lower abundances. Cluster analysis revealed four distinct groups of co-occurring zooplankton taxa. Two of these were numerically dominant, one characterized by the copepod Acartia spp. and a second consisting of several copepod taxa (including larger-bodied genera) and salps. Relative to the group containing Acartia spp., this second dominant group was more abundant at higher salinity, lower temperature and greater vertical extent of hypoxic water into the water column above the seafloor. Dissolved oxygen, as vertical extent of hypoxia, was of comparable importance to temperature and salinity in predicting the abundances of zooplankton taxa. Variability of the zooplankton community with environmental conditions, and particularly the greater abundance of larger taxa in association with hypoxia, has implications for the contribution of zooplankton-mediated vertical flux to oxygen drawdown, and for the quality of the food environment for larval and other planktivorous fish.},

Vascular aquatic plant diversity may not necessarily enhance wetland ecosystem functioning, however, because competition among these plant species can be strong, often resulting in the local dominance of a single species. Here we have manipulated the species richness of rooted, submerged aquatic plant (macrophyte) communities in experimental wetland mesocosms. We found higher algal and total plant (algal plus macrophyte) biomass, as well as lower loss of total phosphorus, in mesocosms with a greater richness of macrophyte species. Greater plant biomass resulted from a sampling effect; that is, the increased chance in species mixtures that algal production would be facilitated by the presence of a less competitive species-in this case, crisped pondweed. Lower losses of total phosphorus resulted from the greater chance in species mixtures of a high algal biomass and the presence of sago pondweed, which physically filter particulate phosphorus from the water. These indirect and direct effects of macrophyte species richness on algal production, total plant biomass and phosphorus loss suggest that management practices that maintain macrophyte diversity may enhance the functioning and associated services of wetland ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Increasing concentrations of organic matter ( OM) in surface waters have been noted over large parts of the boreal/nemoral zone in Europe and North America. This has raised questions about the causes and the likelihood of further increases. A number of drivers have been proposed, including temperature, hydrology, as well as SO42 - and Cl (-) deposition. The data reported so far, however, have been insufficient to define the relative importance of different drivers in landscapes where they interact. Thirty-five years of monthly measurements of absorbance and chemical oxygen demand ( COD), two common proxies for OM, from 28 large Scandinavian catchments provide an unprecedented opportunity to resolve the importance of hypothesized drivers. For 21 of the catchments, there are 18 years of total organic carbon (TOC) measurements as well. Despite the heterogeneity of the catchments with regards to climate, size and land use, there is a high degree of synchronicity in OM across the entire region. Rivers go from widespread trends of decreasing OM to increasing trends and back again three times in the 35-year record. This synchronicity in decadal scale oscillations and long-term trends suggest a common set of dominant OM drivers in these landscapes. Here, we use regression models to test the importance of different potential drivers. We show that flow and SO42 - together can predict most of the interannual variability in OM proxies, up to 88\% for absorbance, up to 78\% for COD. Two other candidate drivers, air temperature and Cl (-) , add little explanatory value. Declines in anthropogenic SO42 - since the mid-1970s are thus related to the observed OM increases in Scandinavia, but, in contrast to many recent studies, flow emerges as an even more important driver of OM variability. Stabilizing SO42 - levels also mean that hydrology is likely to be the major driver of future variability and trends in OM.},

  abstract = {Since 1985, the coastal embayments of Long Island, New York, have been plagued with recurrent blooms, aptly called brown tides, of the pelagophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens. The distinct ocean color observed during these blooms suggests that optical methods can be used as a tool to study, detect, and track brown tides. Thus, the goal of our project was to compare the optical properties and pigment composition during bloom and non-bloom conditions and assess temporal variations in the phytoplankton and other constituents in the seawater associated with bloom development. From 17 May to 8 June 2000, we measured a time series of particle size distributions and concentrations as well as size-fractioned algal pigments and optical properties in two Long Island embayments where brown tides are known to occur. During our study, A. anophagefferens represented an insignificant contribution to the algal community in West Neck Bay (WNB), whereas a bloom developed in Quantuck Bay (QB). Initially, temperature and salinity were similar at the two locations; however, bulk optical properties, chlorophyll, and particle concentrations were nearly a factor of 2 greater at QB. Bulk optical properties remained constant at WNB, yet increased exponentially at QB as the bloom developed. The composition of particulates, including phytoplankton, varied little at QB, and the optical properties suggested the dominance of A. anophagefferens (confirmed by microscopy). The largest temporal variations were observed in the colored dissolved organic material (CDOM); the colloidal (0.2-0.7 ??m) fraction, exhibiting a strong protein-like signal, increased dramatically at the height of the bloom. At WNB particle sizes and algal composition varied despite the invariant bulk optical properties; CDOM variations were minimal. Overall, the optical properties in the two bays demonstrated that at QB temporal variations were dominated by biomass and colloidal protein changes, whereas shifts in the algal community occurred at WNB. This study demonstrates the utility of in situ optical observations to resolve temporal changes in the ecological conditions associated with algal bloom development. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Since 1988, there has been, on average, a 91\% increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of UK lakes and streams in the Acid Waters Monitoring Network (AWMN). Similar DOC increases have been observed in surface waters across much of Europe and North America. Much of the debate about the causes of rising DOC has, as in other studies relating to the carbon cycle, focused on factors related to climate change. Data from our peat-core experiments support an influence of climate on DOC, notably an increase in production with temperature under aerobic, and to a lesser extent anaerobic, conditions. However, we argue that climatic factors may not be the dominant drivers of DOC change. DOC solubility is suppressed by high soil water acidity and ionic strength, both of which have decreased as a result of declining sulphur deposition since the 1980s, augmented during the 1990s in the United Kingdom by a cyclical decline in sea-salt deposition. Our observational and experimental data demonstrate a clear, inverse and quantitatively important link between DOC and sulphate concentrations in soil solution. Statistical analysis of 11 AWMN lakes suggests that rising temperature, declining sulphur deposition and changing sea-salt loading can account for the majority of the observed DOC trend. This combination of evidence points to the changing chemical composition of atmospheric deposition, particularly the substantial reduction in anthropogenic sulphur emissions during the last 20 years, as a key cause of rising DOC. The implications of rising DOC export for the carbon cycle will be very different if linked primarily to decreasing acid deposition, rather than to changes in climate, suggesting that these systems may be recovering rather than destabilising.},

  abstract = {Dissolved humic substances (HS) usually comprise 50-80\% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aquatic ecosystems. From a trophic and biogeochemical perspective, HS has been considered to be highly refractory and is supposed to accumulate in the water. The upsurge of the microbial loop paradigm and the studies on HS photo-degradation into labile DOC gave rise to the belief that microbial processing of DOC should sustain aquatic food webs in humic waters. However, this has not been extensively supported by the literature, since most HS and their photo-products are often oxidized by microbes through respiration in most nutrient-poor humic waters. Here, we review basic concepts, classical studies, and recent data on bacterial and photo-degradation of DOC, comparing the rates of these processes in highly humic ecosystems and other aquatic ecosystems. We based our review on classical and recent findings from the fields of biogeochemistry and microbial ecology, highlighting some odd results from highly humic Brazilian tropical lagoons, which can reach up to 160 mg C L-1. Highly humic tropical lagoons showed proportionally lower bacterial production rates and higher bacterial respiration rates (i.e., lower bacterial growth efficiency) than other lakes. Zooplankton showed similar delta C-13 to microalgae but not to humic DOC in these highly humic lagoons. Thus, the data reviewed here do not support the microbial loop as an efficient matter transfer pathway in highly humic ecosystems, where it is supposed to play its major role. In addition, we found that some tropical humic ecosystems presented the highest potential DOC photo-chemical mineralization (PM) rates reported in the literature, exceeding up to threefold the rates reported for temperate humic ecosystems. We propose that these atypically high PM rates are the result of a joint effect of the seasonal dynamics of allochthonous humic DOC input to these ecosystems and the high sunlight incidence throughout the year. The sunlight action on DOC is positive to microbial consumption in these highly humic lagoons, but little support is given to the enhancement of bacterial growth efficiency, since the labile photo-chemical products are mostly respired by microbes in the nutrient-poor humic waters. HS may be an important source of energy for aquatic bacteria in humic waters, but it is probably not as important as a substrate to bacterial growth and to aquatic food webs, since HS consumption is mostly channeled through microbial respiration. This especially seems to be the case of humic-rich, nutrient-poor ecosystems, where the microbial loop was supposed to play its major role. Highly humic ecosystems also present the highest PM rates reported in the literature. Finally, light and bacteria can cooperate in order to enhance total carbon degradation in highly humic aquatic ecosystems but with limited effects on aquatic food webs. More detailed studies using C- and N-stable isotope techniques and modeling approaches are needed to better understand the actual importance of HS to carbon cycling in highly humic waters.},

A variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to be produced from DOM photochemistry, including singlet oxygen, (1)O2. Recently, it has been determined that humic-like substances and unknown organic chromophores are significant contributors to sunlight absorption in snowpack; however, DOM photochemistry in snow/ice has received little attention in the literature. We recently showed that DOM plays an important role in indirect photolysis processes in ice, producing ROS and leading to the efficient photodegradation of a probe hydrophobic organic pollutant, aldrin.1 ROS scavenger experiments indicated that (1)O2 played a significant role in the indirect photodegradation of aldrin. Here we quantitatively examine (1)O2 photochemically produced from DOM in frozen and liquid aqueous solutions. Steady-state (1)O2 production is enhanced up to nearly 1000 times in frozen DOM samples compared to liquid samples. (1)O2 production is dependent on the concentration of DOM, but the nature of the DOM source (terrestrial vs microbial) does not have a significant effect on (1)O2 production in liquid or frozen samples, with different source types producing similar steady-state concentrations of (1)O2. The temperature of frozen samples also has a significant effect on steady-state (1)O2 production in the range of 228-262 K, with colder samples producing more steady-state (1)O2. The large enhancement in (1)O2 in frozen samples suggests that it may play a significant role in the photochemical processes that occur in snow and ice, and DOM could be a significant, but to date poorly understood, oxidant source in snow and ice.},

  abstract = {Understanding how the concentration and chemical quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) varies in soils is critical because DOM influences an array of biological, chemical, and physical processes. We used PARAFAC modeling of excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy, specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate the chemical quality of DOM in soil water collected from 25 cm piezometers in four different wetland and forest soils: bog, forested wetland, fen and upland forest. There were significant differences in soil solution concentrations of dissolved organic C, N, and P, DOC:DON ratios, SUVA(254) and BDOC among the four soil types. Throughout the sampling period, average DOC concentrations in the four soil types ranged from 9-32 mg C l(-1) and between 23-42\% of the DOC was biodegradable. Seasonal patterns in dissolved nutrient concentrations and BDOC were observed in the three wetland types suggesting strong biotic controls over DOM concentrations in wetland soils. PARAFAC modeling of excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy showed that protein-like fluorescence was positively correlated (r(2) = 0.82; P {$<$} 0.001) with BDOC for all soil types taken together. This finding indicates that PARAFAC modeling may substantially improve the ability to predict BDOC in natural environments. Coincident measurements of DOM concentrations, BDOC and PARAFAC modeling confirmed that the four soil types contain DOM with distinct chemical properties and have unique fluorescent fingerprints. DOM inputs to streams from the four soil types therefore have the potential to alter stream biogeochemical processes differently by influencing temporal patterns in stream heterotrophic productivity.},

  abstract = {Techniques for preserving surface water samples are recently in demand because of the increased interest in quantifying dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters and the frequent collection of samples in remote locations. Freezing is a common technique employed by many researchers for preserving surface water samples; however, there has been little evaluation of the effects of freezing on DOM concentrations. Ten streams were sampled in southeast Alaska with a range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (1.5 to 39??mg C L- 1) to evaluate the influence of freezing (flash and standard freeze) and filter pore size (0.2 and 0.7????m nominal pore size) on dissolved organic C, N and P concentrations. We report a significant decrease in DOC (p {$<$} 0.005) and total dissolved P (p {$<$} 0.005) concentrations when streamwater samples were frozen, whereas concentrations of dissolved organic N did not significantly decrease after freezing (p = 0.06). We further show that when surface water samples were frozen, there was a decrease in the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) of DOC that is particularly evident with high concentrations of DOC. This finding suggests that spectroscopic properties of DOC have the potential to be used as indicators of whether surface water samples can be frozen. Our results lead us to recommend that surface water samples with high DOC concentrations ({$>$} 5??mg C L- 1) and/or samples with high SUVA values ({$>$} 3.5-4??L mg-C- 1 m- 1) should be analyzed immediately and not frozen. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We combined PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate seasonal changes in the lability of DOM along a soil-stream continuum in three soil types: bog, forested wetland and upland forest. The percent BDOC ranged from 7 to 38\% across all sites, and was significantly greater in soil compared to streamwater in the bog and forested wetland, but not in the upland forest. The percent BDOC also varied significantly over the entire sampling period in soil and streamwater for the bog and forested wetland, as BDOC peaked during the spring runoff and was lowest during the summer months. Moreover, the chemical quality of DOM in wetland soil and streamwater was similar during the spring runoff and fall wet season, as demonstrated by the similar contribution of protein-like fluorescence (sum of tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence) in soil water and in streams. These findings suggest that the tight coupling between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is responsible for the delivery of labile DOM from wetland soils to streams. The contribution of protein-like fluorescence was significantly correlated with BDOC (p {$<$} 0.001) over the entire sampling period indicating DOM is an important source of C and N for heterotrophic microbes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the production of protein-rich, labile DOM and subsequent loss in stream runoff might be an important loss of labile C and N from coastal temperate watersheds.},

Our second measure for verifying whether EEMs were fit well to the CM model was a comparison of correlations between the percent contribution of PARAFAC components and DOM measurements (e.g., dissolved nutrient concentrations), and we found no significant difference (p {$>$} 0.05) between the two models. These results support the approach of fitting EEMs to an existing model when DOM is collected from similar environments, which can potentially reduce some of the problems when building an original PARAFAC model.

We compare the uptake kinetics for NH4-N and different fractions of DOM during soil and salmon leachate additions by evaluating the uptake of organic forms of carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), and proteinaceous DOM, as measured by parallel factor (PARAFAC) modeling of DOM fluorescence. Seasonal DOM slug additions were conducted in three headwater streams draining a bog, forested wetland, and upland forest using DOM collected by leaching watershed soils. We also used DOM collected from bog soil and salmon carcasses to perform additions in the upland forest stream. DOC uptake velocity ranged from 0.010 to 0.063 mm s(-1) and DON uptake velocity ranged from 0.015 to 0.086 mm s(-1), which provides evidence for the whole-stream uptake of allochthonous DOM. These findings imply that wetlands could potentially be an important source of DOM to support stream heterotrophic production. There was no significant difference in the uptake of DOC and DON across the soil leachate additions (P {$>$} 0.05), although differential uptake of DOM fractions was observed as protein-like fluorescence was removed from the water column more efficiently than bulk DOC and DON (P {$<$} 0.05). Moreover, PARAFAC analysis of DOM fluorescence showed that protein-like fluorescence decreased downstream during all DOM additions, whereas humic-like fluorescence did not change. This differential processing in added DOM suggests slow and fast turnover pools exist for aquatic DOM. Taken together, our findings argue that DON could potentially fill a larger role in satisfying biotic N demand in oligotrophic headwater streams than previously thought.},

To assess the origin and nature of glacier DOC, we collected snow from 10 locations along a transect across the Juneau Icefield, Alaska extending from the coast toward the interior. The ?14C-DOC of snow varied from ?743 to ?420? showing progressive depletion across the Icefield as {$\delta$}18O of water became more depleted (R2 = 0.56). Older DOC corresponded to lower DOC concentrations in snow (R2 = 0.31) and a decrease in percent humic-like fluorescence (R2 = 0.36), indicating an overall decrease in modern DOC across the Icefield. Carbon isotopic signatures (13C and 14C) combined with a three-source mixing model showed that DOC deposited in snow across the Icefield reflects fossil fuel combustion products (43?73\%) and to a lesser extent marine (21?41\%) and terrestrial sources (1?26\%). Our finding that combustion aerosols are a large source of DOC to the glacier ecosystem during the early spring (April?May) together with the pronounced rates of glacier melting in the region suggests that the delivery of relic DOC to the ocean may be increasing and consequently impacting the biogeochemistry of glacial and proglacial ecosystems in unanticipated ways.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The ice-covered central Arctic Ocean is characterized by low primary productivity due to light and nutrient limitations. The recent reduction in ice cover has the potential to substantially increase phytoplankton primary production, but little is yet known about the fate of the ice-associated primary production and of the nutrient supply with increasing warming. This study presents results from the central Arctic Ocean collected during summer 2012, when sea-ice extent reached its lowest ever recorded since the onset of satellite observations. Net primary productivity (NPP) was measured in the water column, sea ice and melt ponds by 14CO2 uptake at different irradiances. Photosynthesis vs. irradiance (PI) curves were established in laboratory experiments and used to upscale measured NPP to the deep Eurasian Basin (north of 78\textdegree{} N) using the irradiance-based Central Arctic Ocean Primary Productivity (CAOPP) model. In addition, new annual production has been calculated from the seasonal nutrient drawdown in the mixed layer since last winter. Results show that ice algae can contribute up to 60\% to primary production in the central Arctic Ocean at the end of the productive season (August\textendash September). The ice-covered water column has lower NPP rates than open water due to light limitation in late summer. As indicated by the nutrient ratios in the euphotic zone, nitrate was limiting primary production in the deep Eurasian Basin close to the Laptev Sea area, while silicate was the main limiting nutrient at the ice margin near the Atlantic inflow. Although sea-ice cover was substantially reduced in 2012, total annual new production in the Eurasian Basin was 17 {$\pm$} 7 Tg C yr-1, which is within the range of estimates of previous years. However, when adding the contribution by sub-ice algae, the annual production for the deep Eurasian Basin (north of 78\textdegree{} N) could double previous estimates for that area with a surplus of 16 Tg C yr-1. Our data suggest that sub-ice algae are an important component of the productivity in the ice-covered Eurasian Basin of the central Arctic Ocean. It remains an important question whether their contribution to productivity is on the rise with thinning ice, or whether it will decline due to overall sea-ice retreat and be replaced by phytoplankton.},

Absorption coefficients of CDOM and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved lignin were measured on a seasonal basis in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers and in surface waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGoM). A strong, linear relationship between lignin concentrations and CDOM absorption coefficients indicated lignin is an important chromophore in this environment. The dual nature of lignin as an important chromophore in CDOM and as a terrigenous component of DOC facilitated development of the tracer. The applicability of the tracer relies on the existence of a strong, nonlinear relationship between S275\textendash 295 and the DOC-normalized lignin yield in rivers and along the freshwater\textendash marine continuum in the NGoM. Physical mixing and the effects of photodegradation on S275\textendash 295 and dissolved lignin were largely responsible for maintaining this relationship, suggesting the tracer is applicable to surface waters of most river-influenced ocean margins. The spectral slope coefficient (S275\textendash 295) provides new capabilities to trace tDOC on synoptic scales of relevance to ocean margins and represents an important tool for improving ocean carbon budgets.},

Recent studies revealed the 275\textendash 295 nm spectral slope coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), S275\textendash 295, is a reliable tracer for terrigenous dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) in river-influenced ocean margins. Here an empirical algorithm for the accurate retrieval of S275\textendash 295 from ocean color was developed and validated using in situ optical properties collected seasonally in the northern Gulf of Mexico. This study also demonstrated S275\textendash 295 is a robust proxy for tDOC concentration in this environment, thereby providing a means to derive surface tDOC concentrations on synoptic scales and in quasi-real time using remote sensing. The resulting tDOC-algorithm was implemented using Aqua-MODIS in a retrospective analysis of surface tDOC concentrations over the northern Gulf of Mexico between July 2002 and June 2013. Large pulses of tDOC were observed in continental-slope surface waters off the Mississippi River delta, indicating cross-shelf export of tDOC was sporadic and exhibited considerable interannual variability. Favorable winds following an anomalously high discharge from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya river system always coincided with a major export event, and in general, cross-shelf export was enhanced during years of anomalously high discharge. The tDOC-algorithm will find applicability in the assessment of future climate- and human-induced changes in tDOC export, in biogeochemical models of the continental shelf, and in the validation of high-resolution coastal models of buoyancy-driven shelf circulation.},

  abstract = {Aquatic Ecosystems explains the interplay between various movements of matter and energy through ecosystems mediated by Dissolved Organic Matter. This book provides information on how much DOM there is in a particular aquatic ecosystem and where it originates. It explains whether the DOM composition varies from time to time and place to place. It also details how DOM becomes incorporated into microbial food webs, and gives a better, clarifying, understanding to its significance of DOM. Dissolved Organic Matter (called DOM) is incredibly important in all aquatic ecosystems. Although it might seem that logs and leaves are more important, in fact the DOM is more crucial because the DOM is in a form that is available for use by all the organisms living in the the water. Furthermore, DOM influences complex food webs by mediating the availability of aquatic nutrients, metals, salts and minerals. DOM also affects water clarity, which of course has alters the way animals and plants live and feed in the water. There are many ways to study DOM and this book focuses on several central questions. How much DOM is there in a particular aquatic ecosytem? Where does it come from? Does the composition of the DOM vary from time to time and place to palce? How does DOM become incorporated into microbial food webs, which are the basis of plant, invertebrate and vertebrate food webs? How can the answers to these and other questions about DOM be considered together so that a better understanding of the significance of DOM can emerge?

This chapter discusses two independent, but potentially covarying variables that may affect microbial responses: (1) the bulk concentration of DOM, and (2) the known or inferred composition of that DOM. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often the largest input of organic carbon to aquatic ecosystems, and benthic or pelagic bacteria presumably mediate many of the transformations of \{DOM\} into biomass or inorganic components. The availability of inorganic nutrients has significant effects on bacterial growth, even in ecosystems where ambient nutrient concentrations suggest that they should not be limiting. Extracellular enzymes appear more responsive (greater scope) than bacterial production or respiration, implying that there is sufficient dynamic range for these enzymes to catabolize shifting sources of DOM. Experiments of the commonly assayed enzymes, the two with the highest activity, and greatest scope have a role in N or P acquisition. This pattern again suggests that the availability of inorganic or organic nutrients has a particularly strong regulatory role for degradative activity.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the major form of organic matter transported by large rivers and represents an important movement of carbon from terrestrial to coastal systems. Concentrations of DOC in New York's Hudson River have doubled over the past 16 years, implying a substantial increase in net movement of organic carbon from the watershed to New York Harbor and Bight. During the same time period there has been a decline in net consumption of DOC during travel through the tidal freshwater portion of the Hudson. This reduced removal of DOC amplifies the apparent increased load of DOC from the Hudson's watershed, resulting in an overall doubling of DOC delivery to the lower reaches. Either factor changing in isolation could cause a substantial increase in carbon delivery, but the two acting in concert suggest a fundamental change in processes supplying carbon to surface waters. Temperature, water yield, and land cover have not changed in ways that would make these viable causes for the altered DOC. One plausible mechanism driving both of these changes is a soil microbial response to nitrogen deposition, resulting in greater export of humic material. Other surface waters draining regions receiving continued high rates of nitrogen deposition may be undergoing similar, currently undetected shifts in quantity and composition of carbon in transport.},

We found a strong negative relationship between herbivore delta(13)C(which reflects algal delta(13)C) and water velocity in three productive Northern California rivers but not in unproductive streams. The contrast among habitats suggests that water velocity affects algal delta(13)C most strongly when CO2 availability is low relative to photosynthetic rates. Our results help explain the wide variation in published river biota delta(13)C and show that past studies using carbon isotope analyses may have significantly underestimated the importance of algal-derived carbon to liver food webs. While flow-related variation in delta(13)C complicates this common application of carbon isotope analysis, we show that it provides a natural tracer of the flux of algal production derived from different habitats within rivers to higher trophic levels. Measurements of consumer delta(13)C showed that most invertebrate and vertebrate consumers relied on local production, except for filter-feeding insects and steelhead trout, which relied on production derived from multiple sources. Stable carbon isotopes may thus be used to spatially delineate the habitats that support river food webs, providing previously unavailable information for understanding and managing river ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Stable-isotope ratios of carbon (C-13/C-12 or delta C-13) have been widely used to determine the energy base of stream food webs, but such use is controversial due to unexplained variability in algal delta C-13. I used published delta C-13 data from temperate headwater streams through medium-sized rivers (0.2-4000 km(2) watershed area) collected during summer baseflows and original data from streams in northern California to analyze energy pathways through river food webs. The analyses showed three important results. First, epilithic algal delta C-13 and watershed area are positively related, suggesting that effects of carbon Limitation on algal carbon uptake result in C-13 enrichment of algal delta C-13 in larger, more productive rivers. Second, epilithic algae and terrestrial detritus delta C-13 values are often distinct in small shaded streams but overlap in some larger unshaded streams and rivers. Measurements of delta C-13 values may be most useful in distinguishing algal and terrestrial energy sources in unproductive streams with supersaturated dissolved CO, concentrations, and some productive rivers where CO, concentrations are low relative to photosynthetic rates. Finally, consumer delta C-13 values are more strongly related to algal delta C-13 than terrestrial delta C-13. The relative contribution of terrestrial and algal carbon sources often varied by functional feeding group within and between sites. However, with the exception of shredders and scrapers, which respectively relied on terrestrial and algal carbon sources, patterns of consumer delta C-13 clearly show a transition from terrestrial to algal carbon sources for many lotic food webs in streams with greater than or equal to 10 km(2) watershed area. The observed transition to algal carbon sources is likely related to increasing primary production rates as forest canopy cover declines in larger streams, although decreasing retention or quality of terrestrial carbon may also play a role. Improved analyses of algal delta C-13 and delta N-15 combined with quantitative study of organic matter dynamics and food web structure should allow the relative importance of these factors to be distinguished in future food web studies.},

Changes in water transparency have also been widely linked to eutrophication and phytoplankton biomass. This study aimed to describe the development of water transparency in the Baltic Sea through a unique century-long set of Secchi depth observations. Furthermore, the aim was to explain the role of phytoplankton in determining water transparency in these optically complex waters. Water transparency in the open Baltic Sea has decreased during the last one hundred years. The development differs between the sub-basins of the Baltic Sea. The decrease has been most profound in the north-eastern Baltic sub-basins, but apparent also in parts of the Southern and Central Baltic. In many of the northern areas the decrease has accelerated during the last decades, whereas in the Southern Baltic a recent increase was observed. The analysis of simultaneous chlorophyll . a observations during the period from 1972 to 2006 revealed that during summer time, 13-17\% of the light attenuation can be attributed to phytoplankton. In spring, the average proportion is between 31 and 42\%, with great variation between observations. We find Secchi depth a suitable indicator of eutrophication, integrating various organic matter related features. It should always be applied with sufficient background information of the optical properties of the water mass, and complemented by other indicators. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Data were obtained using novel Surface and Under Ice Trawls (SUIT), which sampled the 0-2 m surface layer both under sea ice and in open water. Average surface layer densities ranged between 0.8 individuals m(-2) in summer and autumn, and 2.7 individuals m(-2) in winter. In summer, under-ice densities of Antarctic krill were significantly higher than in open waters. In autumn, the opposite pattern was observed. Under winter sea ice, densities were often low, but repeatedly far exceeded summer and autumn maxima. Statistical models showed that during summer high densities of Antarctic krill in the 0-2 m layer were associated with high ice coverage and shallow mixed layer depths, among other factors. In autumn and winter, density was related to hydrographical parameters. Average under-ice densities from the 0-2 m layer were higher than corresponding values from the 0-200 m layer collected with Rectangular Midwater Trawls (RMT) in summer. In winter, under-ice densities far surpassed maximum 0-200 m densities on several occasions. This indicates that the importance of the ice-water interface layer may be under-estimated by the pelagic nets and sonars commonly used to estimate the population size of Antarctic krill for management purposes, due to their limited ability to sample this habitat. Our results provide evidence for an almost year-round association of Antarctic krill with the under-ice habitat, hundreds of kilometres into the ice-covered area of the Lazarev Sea. Local concentrations of postlarval Antarctic krill under winter sea ice suggest that sea ice biota are important for their winter survival. These findings emphasise the susceptibility of an ecological key species to changing sea ice habitats, suggesting potential ramifications on Antarctic ecosystems induced by climate change.},

Each of these sources may support different bacterial growth rates, but few studies have specifically analyzed the effects of the combination of different carbon sources on bacterial metabolism. In this study, we evaluated the response of several metabolic parameters, including bacterial biomass production (BP), bacterial respiration (BR), bacterial growth efficiency (BGE), and bacterial community structure, on the presence of three DOC sources alone and in combination. We hypothesized that the mixture of different DOC sources would increase the efficiency of carbon use by bacteria (BGE). We established a full-factorial substitutive design (seven treatments) in which the effects of the number and identity of DOC sources on bacterial metabolism were evaluated. We calculated the expected metabolic rates of the combined DOC treatments based on the single-DOC treatments and observed a positive interaction on BP, a negative interaction on BR, and, consequently, a positive interaction on BGE for the combinations. The bacterial community composition appeared to have a minor impact on differences in bacterial metabolism among the treatments. Our data indicate that mixtures of DOC sources result in a more efficient biological use of carbon. This study provides strong evidence that the mixture of different DOC sources is a key factor affecting the role of bacteria in the carbon flux of aquatic ecosystems.},

Of all of the species in these communities, the relatively large cladoceran Ceriodaphnia reticulata significantly responded to the treatments, and had a higher probability of achieving high densities when connectance was high. As such, A e suggest that this species played a large role in driving the increased local community similarity and decreased regional species richness as connectivity increased.

The focus of this chapter is to examine studies in both marine and freshwater ecosystems that attempt to link specific members of the bacterial community with specific aspects of DOM processing. To address the seemingly inherent unculturability of bacteria from natural environments, researchers turned to molecular biological techniques to identify bacteria. There are several different methods based on 16S rRNA sequences that can be used to study bacterial community structure. Functional processes are essentially the same in both freshwater and marine systems, the differences become apparent when the emphasis is placed on the source of the Organic Matter (OM). The source of this OM affects the rate at which it is used, not the overall process of use. The availability of organic and inorganic resources and removal of cells by grazing or viral loss are major mechanisms involved in bacterial production and mortality, and thus it is conceivable that these may also regulate microbial population dynamics and diversity.},

  abstract = {At the C-SOLAS Lagrangian Study site, the phytoplankton community was dominated by diatoms in declining bloom conditions, which were characterised by a decrease in primary production over time. Measurements of primary production were performed using photosynthesis-light experiments and simulated in situ incubations. Several methods were used to assign photosynthetic parameters for estimation of primary production from remote-sensing of ocean colour: (1) the nearest-neighbour method (NNM), (2) a temperature-dependent model, (3) an iterative approach to retrieve photosynthetic parameters from in situ measurements of phytoplankton production, and (4) average values of measured parameters. Owing to the declining status of the diatom population and its patchy distribution, the magnitude of primary production measured from in situ incubations was highly variable. Under bloom conditions, all methods underestimated production compared with results of simulated in situ measurements; however, the NNM provided the closest estimates to the in situ measurements. In the declining bloom phase, the NNM overestimated primary production, whereas the iterative method returned estimates of production in good agreement with the in situ observations. In conditions characterized by mixed-phytoplankton populations, the NNM returned estimates in agreement with the observations. A new method is proposed for classifying image pixels using criteria accessible to remote sensing, according to the phase of the diatom bloom (bloom versus declining conditions) and according to community composition (diatom versus mixed population). Upon separating the database used for parameter assignment into 2 parts, one representing the general phytoplankton community and the other representing declining diatom conditions, estimates of chlorophyll a-normalised water-column production were in good agreement with in situ observations. \textcopyright{} Inter-Research 2007.},

However, it has been suggested that richness-climate relationships differ significantly among geographic regions and that there is no globally consistent relationship. This study investigated the global patterns of species and family richness of angiosperms in relation to climate. We found that models relating angiosperm richness to mean annual temperature, annual water deficit, and their interaction or models relating richness to annual potential evapotranspiration and water deficit are both globally consistent and very strong and are independent of the diverse evolutionary histories and functional assemblages of plants in different parts of the world. Thus, effects of other factors such as evolutionary history, postglacial dispersal, soil nutrients, topography, or other climatic variables either must be quite minor over broad scales (because there is little residual variation left to explain) or they must be strongly collinear with global patterns of climate. The correlations shown here must be predicted by any successful hypothesis of mechanisms controlling richness patterns.},

  abstract = {We typically observe large-scale outcomes that arise from the interactions of many hidden, small-scale processes. Examples include age of disease onset, rates of amino acid substitutions and composition of ecological communities. The macroscopic patterns in each problem often vary around a characteristic shape that can be generated by neutral processes. A neutral generative model assumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased or random stochastic fluctuations: random connections of network nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on fitness; species that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These neutral generative models often match common patterns of nature. In this paper, I present the theoretical background by which we can understand why these neutral generative models are so successful. I show where the classic patterns come from, such as the Poisson pattern, the normal or Gaussian pattern and many others. Each classic pattern was often discovered by a simple neutral generative model. The neutral patterns share a special characteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that follow from simple constraints on information. For example, any aggregation of processes that preserves information only about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the mean attracts to the exponential pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the geometric mean attracts to the power law pattern. I present a simple and consistent informational framework of the common patterns of nature based on the method of maximum entropy. This framework shows that each neutral generative model is a special case that helps to discover a particular set of informational constraints; those informational constraints define a much wider domain of non-neutral generative processes that attract to the same neutral pattern.},

Fluvial lakes pose unique challenges for photobiologists interested in the interactions amongst light climate, nutrients and microbial community structure and biodiversity. This is because fluvial lakes are typified by highly dynamic flow regimes often incorporating different inflows and discharges each characterized by their own unique physico-chemical composition. These compositional characteristics include the concentrations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), suspended solids, and pigments such as chlorophyll. Together these factors contribute to the distribution and composition of the water masses that make up fluvial lakes. These water masses, in turn, flow over lakebeds that are typically complex in their morphometry and feature extensive macrophyte beds, further enhancing the habitat heterogeneity of these ecosystems. We here report on the spectral attenuation of ultraviolet radiation (UVR = 280-400 nm) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR = 400-700 nm) in the three main water masses of Lake Saint-Pierre and evaluate the relative contribution of CDOM, and particulate organic material to UVR attenuation. We demonstrate that UVR penetrates 18 to 30\% of the water column (1\% penetration depth) in the Lake Saint-Pierre ecosystem, and show how the underwater spectral UVR varies within the three water masses.},

We used these variables as tracers to reveal the extent and magnitude of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in this large, shallow, fluvial lake of the St. Lawrence River. We superimposed these tracer variables over radiance data obtained from satellite images to identify spatial and temporal changes in the distribution of different water masses and their bio-optical components. The underwater light environment showed strong horizontal (longitudinal and lateral) variability because of the strong connectivity between the terrestrial and aquatic environments in the lake's tributaries and adjoining wetlands. Analyzing the downstream distribution of optical and chemical variables as a function of transport time rather than distance from source tributaries allowed us to demonstrate large differences in the age of the different water masses depending on the characteristics of the source tributary, in-stream processes, and distance from its source. CDOM explained most of the UV attenuation and allowed the greatest discrimination between water masses.},

In large rivers, hydraulic connectivity operates as a major forcing variable to structure the functioning of the riverscape, and\textendash despite increasing interest in large-river studies\textendash riverscape structural properties, such as the underwater spectral regime, and their impact on autotrophic ecological processes remain poorly studied. Here we used the St. Lawrence River to identify the mechanisms structuring the underwater spectral environment and their consequences on pico- and nanophytoplankton communities, which are good biological tracers of environmental changes. Our results, obtained from a 450 km sampling transect, demonstrate that tributaries exert a profound impact on the receiving river's photosynthetic potential. This occurs mainly through injection of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and non-algal material (tripton). CDOM and tripton in the water column selectively absorbed wavelengths in a gradient from blue to red, and the resulting underwater light climate was in turn a strong driver of the phytoplankton community structure (prokaryote/eukaryote relative and absolute abundances) at scales of many kilometers from the tributary confluence. Our results conclusively demonstrate the proximal impact of watershed properties on underwater spectral composition in a highly dynamic river environment characterized by unique structuring properties such as high directional connectivity, numerous sources and forms of carbon, and a rapidly varying hydrodynamic regime. We surmise that the underwater spectral composition represents a key integrating and structural property of large, heterogeneous river ecosystems and a promising tool to study autotrophic functional properties. It confirms the usefulness of using the riverscape approach to study large-river ecosystems and initiate comparison along latitudinal gradients.},

Field observations of sea ice physical and optical properties were collected in this region during June\textendash July 2010, revealing unexpectedly complex spatial distributions of solar radiation under the melt-season ice cover. Based on our optical measurements of first-year ice, we found the under-ice light field in the upper ocean to be spatially heterogeneous and dependent on wavelength, ice thickness, and the areal and geometric distribution of melt ponded and bare ice surfaces. Much of the observed complexity in radiation fields arose because the transmission of light through ponded ice was generally an order of magnitude greater than through bare, unponded ice. Furthermore, while many sites exhibited a consistent, exponential decay in light transmission through both ponded and bare ice surfaces, light transmission under bare ice was also observed to increase with depth (reaching maximum values {$\sim$}5\textendash 10 m below the bottom of the ice). A simple geometric model shows these transmission peaks are a result of scattering in the ice and the interspersion of bare and ponded sea ice sur- faces. These new observations of complex radiation fields beneath melt-season first-year sea ice have significant impli- cations for biological production, biogeochemical processes, and the heat balance of sea ice and under-ice ocean waters and should be carefully considered when modeling these sea ice- related phenomena.},

Bacterial cells were separated from phytoplankton and detritus with glass fiber and membrane filters (pore size, 0.8 \&mgr;m) and then concentrated by tangential flow filtration. The concentrate was used for the determination of amounts of organic carbon and nitrogen by a high-temperature catalytic oxidation method, and after it was stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, cell abundance was determined by epifluorescence microscopy. We found that the average contents of carbon and nitrogen for oceanic bacterial assemblages were 12.4 +/- 6.3 and 2.1 +/- 1.1 fg cell-1 (mean +/- standard deviation; n = 6), respectively. Corresponding values for coastal bacterial assemblages were 30.2 +/- 12.3 fg of C cell-1 and 5.8 +/- 1.5 fg of N cell-1 (n = 5), significantly higher than those for oceanic bacteria (two-tailed Student's t test; P {$<$} 0.03). There was no significant difference (P {$>$} 0.2) in the bacterial C:N ratio (atom atom-1) between oceanic (6.8 +/- 1.2) and coastal (5.9 +/- 1.1) assemblages. Our estimates support the previous proposition that bacteria contribute substantially to total biomass in marine environments, but they also suggest that the use of a single conversion factor for diverse marine environments can lead to large errors in assessing the role of bacteria in food webs and biogeochemical cycles. The use of a factor, 20 fg of C cell-1, which has been widely adopted in recent studies may result in the overestimation (by as much as 330\%) of bacterial biomass in open oceans and in the underestimation (by as much as 40\%) of bacterial biomass in coastal environments.},

  abstract = {The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica contain many permanently ice-covered lakes that support populations of algae and bacteria in the water column. In these lakes the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is typically greatest at depth. In Lake Fryxell, the DOC concentration is 25 mg C/L at 18 m and 5 mg C/L at 5 m, just below the ice-cover. Dissolved humic substances account for about 20-24\% of the DOC in the lake water. The DOC sources to the photic zone of this lake are streamflow, extracellular release by phytoplankton and benthic algal mats and upward diffusion across the oxycline at 9.5 m. Experiments with fulvic acids isolated from four depths show that these humic substances have the capacity to act as electron acceptors in the anoxic degradation of acetate by an iron-and humic-reducing microorganism. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize the abundance and redox state of the quinone functional groups in the oxidized and reduced fulvic acids in these experiments and in filtered whole water samples from the lake. The fluorescence intensity of fulvic acid was greater in the oxycline and bottomwaters than in the photic zone. This result suggests that incorporation of quinone functional groups into humic substances may be enhanced in zones of high bacterial activity. Statistical analysis of the excitation emission matrices (EEMs) was used to evaluate trends in the fulvic acid redox state with depth. The results indicate that fulvic acid in the upper photic zone was in an oxidized state and that fulvic acid in the bottomwaters was in a reduced state. The shift in the EEMs indicating a more reduced state occurred in the vicinity of the oxycline (8 to 11 m). The shift in the EEMs began in the zone from 8 and 9 m, where dissolved oxygen concentrations range from to 5 and 10 mg L-1, suggesting that fulvic acid was oxidized upon upward diffusion from the oxycline. This oxidation may be an abiotic process in which reduced humic substances interact with ferric iron generated in this zone.},

  abstract = {The coastal upwelling system off the coast of Peru is characterized by high biological activity and a pronounced subsurface oxygen minimum zone, as well as associated emissions of atmospheric trace gases such as N2O, CH4 and CO2. From 3 to 23 December 2012, R/V Meteor (M91) cruise took place in the Peruvian upwelling system between 4.59 and 15.4\textdegree{} S, and 82.0 to 77.5\textdegree{} W. During M91 we investigated the composition of the sea-surface microlayer (SML), the oceanic uppermost boundary directly subject to high solar radiation, often enriched in specific organic compounds of biological origin like chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and marine gels. In the SML, the continuous photochemical and microbial recycling of organic matter may strongly influence gas exchange between marine systems and the atmosphere. We analyzed SML and underlying water (ULW) samples at 38 stations focusing on CDOM spectral characteristics as indicator of photochemical and microbial alteration processes. CDOM composition was characterized by spectral slope (S) values and excitation\textendash emission matrix fluorescence (EEMs), which allow us to track changes in molecular weight (MW) of DOM, and to determine potential DOM sources and sinks. Spectral slope S varied between 0.012 to 0.043 nm-1 and was quite similar between SML and ULW, with no significant differences between the two compartments. Higher S values were observed in the ULW of the southern stations below 15\textdegree{} S. By EEMs, we identified five fluorescent components (F1\textendash 5) of the CDOM pool, of which two had excitation/emission characteristics of amino-acid-like fluorophores (F1, F4) and were highly enriched in the SML, with a median ratio SML : ULW of 1.5 for both fluorophores. In the study region, values for CDOM absorption ranged from 0.07 to 1.47 m-1. CDOM was generally highly concentrated in the SML, with a median enrichment with respect to the ULW of 1.2. CDOM composition and changes in spectral slope properties suggested a local microbial release of DOM directly in the SML as a response to light exposure in this extreme environment. In a conceptual model of the sources and modifications of optically active DOM in the SML and underlying seawater (ULW), we describe processes we think may take place (Fig. 1); the production of CDOM of higher MW by microbial release through growth, exudation and lysis in the euphotic zone, includes the identified fluorophores (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5). Specific amino-acid-like fluorophores (F1, F4) accumulate in the SML with respect to the ULW, as photochemistry may enhance microbial CDOM release by (a) photoprotection mechanisms and (b) cell-lysis processes. Microbial and photochemical degradation are potential sinks of the amino-acid-like fluorophores (F1, F4), and potential sources of reworked and more refractory humic-like components (F2, F3, F5). In the highly productive upwelling region along the Peruvian coast, the interplay of microbial and photochemical processes controls the enrichment of amino-acid-like CDOM in the SML. We discuss potential implications for air\textendash sea gas exchange in this area.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Oceanic particulate organic carbon (POC) is a relatively small (\textasciitilde 4\,Pg\,C) but dynamic component of the global carbon cycle with fast mean turnover rates compared to other oceanic, continental and atmospheric carbon stocks. Biogeochemical models historically focused on reproducing the sinking flux of POC driven by large fast-sinking particles (bPOC). However, suspended and slow-sinking particles (sPOC) typically represent 80\textendash 90\,\% of the POC stock, and can make important seasonal contributions to vertical fluxes through the mesopelagic layer (200\textendash 1000\,m). Recent developments in the parameterization of POC reactivity in the PISCES model (PISCESv2\_RC) have greatly improved its ability to capture sPOC dynamics. Here we evaluated this model by matching 3D and 1D simulations with BGC-Argo and satellite observations in globally representative ocean biomes, building on a refined scheme for converting particulate backscattering profiles measured by BGC-Argo floats to POC. We show that PISCES captures the major features of sPOC and bPOC as seen by BGC-Argo floats across a range of spatiotemporal scales, from highly resolved profile time series to biome-aggregated climatological profiles. Our results also illustrate how the comparison between the model and observations is hampered by (1) the uncertainties in empirical POC estimation, (2) the imperfect correspondence between modelled and observed variables, and (3) the bias between modelled and observed physics. Despite these limitations, we identified characteristic patterns of model-observations misfits in the mesopelagic layer of subpolar and subtropical gyres. These misfits likely result from both suboptimal model parameters and model equations themselves, pointing to the need to improve the model representation of processes with a critical influence on POC dynamics, such as sinking, remineralization, (dis)aggregation and zooplankton activity. Beyond model evaluation results, our analysis identified inconsistencies between current estimates of POC from satellite and BGC-Argo data, as well as POC partitioning into phytoplankton, heterotrophs and detritus deduced from in situ bio-optical data. Our approach can help constrain POC stocks, and ultimately budgets, in the epipelagic and mesopelagic ocean.},

During both years, bottom ice Chl a, DMSPp and DMSPd concentrations were high (up to 1328 {$\mu$}g L-1, 15,082 nmol L-1, and 6110 nmol L-1, respectively) in May and decreased thereafter. The release of bottom ice algae and DMSPp in the water column was gradual in 2010 and rapid (8 days) in 2011. Bottom brine drainage during the presnowmelt period in 2010 and a rapid loss of the snow cover in 2011 coinciding with rain events explain most of the difference between the 2 years. During both years, less than 13\% of the DMSPd lost from the ice was detected in the water column, suggesting a rapid microbial consumption. An under-ice diatom bloom developed in both years. In 2010, the bloom was dominated by centric diatoms while in 2011 pennates dominated, likely reflecting seeding by ice algae following the faster snowmelt progression induced by rainfall events in 2011. Both under-ice blooms were associated with high DMSPp concentrations (up to 185 nmol L-1), but pennate diatoms showed DMSPp/Chl a ratios twice higher than centrics. These results highlight the key role of snowmelt and precipitation on the temporal pattern of ice-DMSP release to the water column and on the timing, taxonomic composition, and DMSP content of phytoplankton under-ice blooms in the Arctic. \textcopyright{} 2014.

The semi-variogram, roughness-length, and two spectral methods are compared using synthetic 1024-point profiles generated by three methods, and using two profiles derived from a gridded DEM and two profiles from a laser-scanned soil surface. The analysis concentrates on the Hurst exponent H,which is linearly related to fractal dimension D,and considers both the accuracy and the variability of the estimates of H.The estimation methods are found to be quite consistent for Hnear 0.5, but the semivariogram method appears to be biased for Happroaching 0 and 1, and the roughness-length method for Happroaching 0. The roughness-length or the maximum entropy spectral methods are recommended as the most suitable methods for estimating the fractal dimension of topographic profiles. The fractal model fitted the soil surface data at fine scales but not at broad scales, and did not appear to fit the DEM profiles well at any scale.},

Extremely high concentrations of CDOM in this river present special problems for the measurement of inherent optical properties, such as the presence of very fine particulate matter that passes through most glass fiber filters. Empirical relationships are presented for estimating true dissolved absorption at very high CDOM concentrations. Specific-absorption and -scattering coefficients of suspended particulate matter varied widely, but appeared to decline steadily with salinity at salinities above 5, consistent with increasing influence of large-sized, unconsolidated mineral particulates with increasing tidal energy near the estuary mouth. Relationships are given for prediction of inherent optical properties from water quality concentrations for use in radiative transfer modeling, and changes in water quality measurements are recommended that can avoid the need for empirical corrections.

One of the main advantages of flow cytometry over epifluorescence microscopy is the ability to obtain cell-specific measurements in large numbers of cells with limited effort. We discuss how this characteristic has been used for differentiating photosynthetic from non-photosynthetic prokaryotes, for measuring bacterial cell size and nucleic acid content, and for estimating the relative activity and physiological state of each cell.

However, although there have been numerous studies of the effects of local-scale changes in land use (e.g. logging) on the abundance of groups of organisms, broader continental or global-scale analyses addressing the same basic issues remain largely wanting. None the less, changing patterns of land use, associated with the appropriation of increasing proportions of net primary productivity by the human population, seem likely not simply to have reduced the diversity of life, but also to have reduced the carrying capacity of the environment in terms of the numbers of other organisms that it can sustain. Here, we estimate the size of the existing global breeding bird population, and then make a first approximation as to how much this has been modified as a consequence of land-use changes wrought by human activities. Summing numbers across different land-use classes gives a best current estimate of a global population of less than 100 billion breeding bird individuals. Applying the same methodology to estimates of original land-use distributions suggests that conservatively this may represent a loss of between a fifth and a quarter of pre-agricultural bird numbers. This loss is shared across a range of temperate and tropical land-use types.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Bacterioplankton plays a central role in energy and matter fluxes in the sea, yet the factors that constrain its variation in marine systems are still poorly understood. Here we use the explanatory power of direct multivariate gradient analysis to evaluate the driving forces exerted by environmental parameters on bacterial community distribution in the water column. We gathered and analysed data from a one month sampling period from the surface to 1000 m depth at the JGOFS-DYFAMED station (NW Mediterranean Sea). This station is characterized by very poor horizontal advection currents which makes it an ideal model to test hypotheses on the causes of vertical stratification of bacterial communities. Capillary electrophoresis single strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP) fingerprinting profiles analyzed using multivariate statistical methods demonstrated a vertical zonation of bacterial assemblages in three layers, above, in or just below the chlorophyll maximum and deeper, that remained stable during the entire sampling period. Through the use of direct gradient multivariate ordination analyses we demonstrate that a complex array of biogeochemical parameters is the driving force behind bacterial community structure shifts in the water column. Physico-chemical parameters such as phosphate, nitrate, salinity and to a lesser extent temperature, oxygen, dissolved organic carbon and photosynthetically active radiation acted in synergy to explain bacterial assemblages changes with depth. Analysis of lipid biomarkers of organic matter sources and fates suggested that bacterial community structure in the surface layers was in part explained by lipids of chloroplast origin. Further detailed analysis of pigment-based phytoplankton diversity gave evidence of a compartmentalized influence of several phytoplankton groups on bacterial community structure in the first 150 m depth.}

In this study, we used generalized additive modelling of the RNA/DNA ratio, an index of short-term growth, to investigate the influence of environmental variables and spatio-temporal variation on growth of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in Lake St. Pierre, Quebec, Canada. Temperature and water level had seemingly stronger effects on short-term growth than seasonal change or spatial variation between and along the lakeshores. Consistent with previous studies, the maximum RNA/DNA ratio was found at 20.5 degrees C, suggesting that our approach provides a useful tool for estimating thermal optima for growth in the field. The RNA/DNA ratio showed a positive relationship with water level, as predicted by the flood pulse concept, a finding with implications for ecosystem productivity in fluvial lakes. The RNA/DNA ratio was more variable along the north than the south shore, possibly reflecting exposure to more differentiated water masses. The negative influence of both high temperatures and low water levels on growth points to potential impacts of climatic change on fish production in shallow fluvial lakes.},

  abstract = {The potential importance of the viral lysis of phytoplankton for nutrient and carbon cycling has been acknowledged, but no quantitative assessments of this phenomenon exist. Radiotracer experiments examined the release and bioavailability of C, N, P, Fe, and Se following viral lysis of the "brown tide" chrysophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens. Photochemical effects on the dissolved-particulate partitioning and biological uptake of virally released elements were also investigated. Viral lysis of A. anophagefferens released 50\% mon C and Se than uninfected control cells to the dissolved phase, while N, P, and Fe remained in the particulate phase. There was a significant inverse correlation between A. anophagefferens and bacterial densities, as well as an increase in particulate organic nitrogen levels in cultures during viral lysis. These observations indicate that released dissolved organic matter supported bacterial growth and may be a pathway by which various elements are diverted in microbial food webs. Dissolved nutrients released by viral lysis were accumulated to varying degrees by natural assemblages of marine bacteria and cultured diatoms, and vitally regenerated N and P relieved diatom nutrient limitation. During a 4-wk incubation, 80\% of C and P within cell lysis debris was released to the dissolved phase, likely due to bacterial activity. Photochemical degradation of cell lysis debris enhanced dissolved levels of Se (100\%) and Fe (50\%) and reduced total dissolved C by 15\%. Photochemistry doubled the bioavailability of virally released Se to diatoms, while decreasing the bioavailability of C to bacteria threefold. The viral lysis of an A. anophagefferens bloom in the field could release 40 mu M dissolved organic carbon and rapidly transfer other released elements to bacteria. Such occurrences may significantly affect water column chemistry, species composition, and succession within marine plankton communities.},

(1970) it has been known that chlorophyll a (or. more generally. pigments) contained in phytoplankton in near-surface waters produced systematic variations in the color of the ocean which could be observed from aircraft. As a direct result of this work. NASA developed the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS). which was launched on Nimbus-G (now Nimbus-7) in October 1978. (A short description of the CZCS is provided in Appendix I.) Shortly before launch. at the IUCRM Colloquium on Passive Radiometry of the Ocean (June 1978). a working group on water color measurements was formed to assess water color remote sensing at that time. A report (Morel and Gordon. 1980) was prepared which summarized the state-of-the-art of the algorithms for atmospheric correction. and phytoplankton pigment and seston retrieval. and which included recommendations concerning the design of next generation sensors. The water color session of the COSPAR/SCOR/IUCRM Symposium 'Oceanography from Space' held in Venice (May 1980. i. e " in the post-launch period) provided the opportunity for a reassessment of the state-of-the-art after having gained some experience in the analysis of the initial CZCS imagery. Such an assessment is the purpose of this review paper. which will begin with an outline of the basic physics of water color remote sensing and the fundamentals of atmospheric corrections. The present state of the constituent retrieval and atmospheric correction algorithms will then be critically assessed},

Algal biomass and primary production were determined for 0.7-5 {$\mu$}m and {$>$} 5 {$\mu$}m size fractions. The algal release rate of DO14C during incubation was also measured. In the Chukchi Sea and in leads of the Makarov and Nansen Basins, total maximum particulate phytoplankton production rates were 2570, 73 and 521 mg C m-2day-1, respectively. At those stations, where ice cover varied from 55 to 90\%, large phytoplankton ({$>$} 5 {$\mu$}m) represented 61-98\% of the total algal biomass. At stations with higher ice coverage ({$>$}90\%), the total phytoplankton production decreased to 9-57 mg C m-2day-1. At these stations, small phytoplankton (0.7-5 {$\mu$}m) accounted for 59-88\% of the total biomass and more than 64\% of the total production. Along the transect, the percentage of the total phytoplankton production released as extracellular carbon was generally less than 20\%, except in the Canadian Basin where it ranged from 31 to 65\%. Total particulate ice algal production ranged from 0.5 to 310 mg C m-2day-1and showed maximum rates in the central Arctic Ocean. Large cells ({$>$} 5 {$\mu$}m) generally dominated the ice algal community, representing 50-100\% of the total biomass and more than 50\%, of the total production. Ice algae released on average 34\% of total carbon fixed during the 4-12 h incubation. Ice algae contributed on average 57\% of the entire primary production (water column + sea ice) in the central Arctic and 3\% in the surrounding regions. Total primary productivity in the central Arctic Ocean is estimated at 15 g C m-2year-1, a value at least 10 times higher than previously reported. The difference between estimates is due in part to the previously unmeasured contribution of the particulate production by ice algae and the release of DOC by both ice and pelagic algae.},

This article compares MODIS satellite images of sea-surface chlorophyll fluorescence, and of chlorophyll concentration as indicated by the standard green/blue ratio, using images made available at 1 km spatial resolution in near-real-time by the NASA Oceancolor web system. In some cases, the implied surface chlorophyll distributions from the two sources agree, and in others they show major differences. Significant disagreement occurs in some coastal waters, where the standard chlorophyll ratio product appears compromised by Coloured Dissolved Organic Material (CDOM). The article shows images from western Canada, and from Bali and the Yellow Sea, areas of interest to present and past Pan-Ocean Remote SEnsing Conference (PORSEC) meetings. The Yellow Sea and to a lesser extent the Bali examples suggest value in fluorescence imaging. In western Canada, the case for using the fluorescence signal is much stronger, in that coastal blooms are much easier to detect using fluorescence rather than the standard `chlorophyll' product.},

  abstract = {Despite recognition of the significance of both food web interactions and habitat complexity in community dynamics, current ecological theory rarely couples these two processes. Experimental manipulations of the abundance of the two predators in an oyster-reef trophic cascade, and the structural complexity provided by reefs of living oysters, demonstrated that enhanced habitat complexity weakened the strengths of trophic interactions. The system of tri-trophic interactions included oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) as the top predator that consumed the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii), which preys upon juvenile oysters (Crassostrea virginica). On reefs of low complexity, toadfish controlled mud crab abundances and indirectly determined the level of mortality of juvenile oysters. The indirect effects of toadfish on oysters emerged through their influence on how intensely mud crabs preyed on oysters. Augmentation of habitat complexity by substituting vertically oriented, living oysters for the flat shells of dead oysters disrupted both of the direct trophic linkages but did not alter the magnitude of the indirect effect of toadfish on juvenile oysters. This paradox can be understood by partitioning the mechanisms by which toadfish influence mud crabs and ultimately juvenile oysters. Trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs; i.e., predator-avoidance behavior in mud crabs) accounted for 95.6\textendash 98.2\% of toadfish indirect benefits to oyster survival and, consequently, were a much greater contributor than density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs; i.e., the reduction in crab abundance by toadfish). Avoidance behavior was unaffected by modification in habitat complexity. Complex reefs increased total oyster survival because added habitat complexity reduced mud crab predation on oysters. Additionally, the magnitude of this effect was much greater than the increase in oyster mortality as a result of complex reefs disrupting toadfish predation on mud crabs. This experimental demonstration of how habitat complexity modifies trophic interactions in a temperate reef community has fundamental implications for our understanding of species interaction webs and community structure. The influence of habitat complexity on the strength of a trophic cascade generally may depend upon whether physical complexity provides actual and perceived refuges for component predator\textendash prey pairs.},

To explore this notion, we estimated the energetic costs of migration and reproduction of Yakima River-bound spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha using a sequential analysis of their proximate composition (i.e., percent water, fat, protein, and ash). Tissues (muscle, viscera, and gonad) were sampled from fish near the start of their migration (Bonneville Dam), at a mid point (Roza Dam, 510km upstream from Bonneville Dam) and from fresh carcasses on the spawning grounds (about 100km above Roza Dam). At Bonneville Dam, the energy reserves of these fish were remarkably high, primarily due to the high percentage of fat in the muscle (18\textendash 20\%; energy content over 11 kJ g?1). The median travel time for fish from Bonneville to Roza Dam was 27 d and ranged from 18 to 42 d. Fish lost from 6 to 17\% of their energy density in muscle, depending on travel time. On average, fish taking a relatively long time for migration between dams used from 5 to 8\%more energy from the muscle than faster fish. From the time they passed Bonneville Damto death, these fish, depending on gender, used 95\textendash 99\% of their muscle and 73\textendash 86\% of their visceral lipid stores. Also, both sexes used about 32\% of their muscular and very little of their visceral protein stores. However, we were unable to relate energy use and reproductive success to migration history. Our results suggest a possible influence of the CRB hydroelectric system on adult salmonid energetics},

  abstract = {Agricultural land covers approximately 40\% of Earth's land surface and affects hydromorphological, biogeochemical and ecological characteristics of fluvial networks. In the northern temperate region, agriculture also strongly affects the amount and molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which constitutes the main vector of carbon transport from soils to fluvial networks and to the sea, and is involved in a large variety of biogeochemical processes. Here, we provide first evidence about the wider occurrence of agricultural impacts on the concentration and composition of fluvial DOM across climate zones of the northern and southern hemispheres. Both extensive and intensive farming altered fluvial DOM towards a more microbial and less plant-derived composition. Moreover, intensive farming significantly increased dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations. The DOM composition change and DON concentration increase differed among climate zones and could be related to the intensity of current and historical nitrogen fertilizer use. As a result of agriculture intensification, increased DON concentrations and a more microbial-like DOM composition likely will enhance the reactivity of catchment DOM emissions, thereby fuelling the biogeochemical processing in fluvial networks, and resulting in higher ecosystem productivity and CO2 outgassing.},

Sterile-filtered (0.2 mu m) water was incubated in UV-transparent quartz tubes and in tubes covered with aluminum foil. Samples were incubated at different depths (0, 0.20, 0.65, and 2.00 m) from sunrise to sunset (0400 to 2200 hours) in July. Inorganic C was measured before and after incubation. Total plankton respiration in unfiltered lake-water (production of DIG) was also measured. At the surface, photo-oxidative DIC production was 86-410 mg C m(-3) d(-1), while plankton community respiration was 101-274 mg C m(-3) d(-1). Photo-oxidation integrated over depth was 44-171 mg C m(-2) d(-1), while respiration was 201-547 mg C m(-2) d(-1) to a depth of 2 m and 398-850 mg C m(-2) d(-1) over the depth of the epilimnion. Depth-integrated photo-oxidation was independent of water color or DOC concentration in the lakes. Photooxidation was detected deeper than the penetration of UV-B radiation, indicating that longer wavelengths (UV-A and possibly PAR) are also active. DIC production was linearly related to loss of fluorescence (excitation 355 nm, emission 455 nm) in light-incubated samples. Our study shows that photo-oxidation of DOC may be an important process causing the regularly observed supersaturation of DIC in lakes.},

  abstract = {Seasonal variations in the stable isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of crustacean zooplankton and their putative food sources in oligotrophic Loch Ness were recorded during 1998. Bulk particulate organic matter (POM) showed delta C-13 values consistent with a terrestrial plant origin from the catchment and exhibited little seasonal variation, whereas POM delta N-15 was more variable, probably due to associated microbial action. In contrast, phytoplankton delta C-13 was relatively light and showed some seasonal variation, but delta N-15 values were more constant. The isotopic signatures of both POM and phytoplankton remained sufficiently distinct from each other throughout the period of study to allow their relative contributions to zooplankton diet to be assessed. Zooplankton isotopic signatures shifted seasonally, reflecting a dietary switch from a reliance on allochthonous carbon derived from POM during winter and early spring to heavy dependence on algal production during summer. Annually, crustacean zooplankton in Loch Ness derive approximately 40\% of their body carbon from allochthonous sources, likely mediated via microbial links. Separate determination of isotope ratios for the main zooplankton species allowed a more detailed trophic investigation. The most abundant zooplankton species in the loch, Eudiaptomus gracilis, incorporated appreciable allochthonous carbon even during the peak of phytoplankton productivity. By contrast, Daphnia hyalina grew mainly in late summer and autumn and derived almost 100\% body carbon from algal sources. This study is the first to quantify such a seasonal switch in zooplankton dependence between allochthonous and autochthonous sources of organic matter in a large lake.},

  abstract = {The Kolyma River basin in northeastern Siberia, the sixth largest river basin draining to the Arctic Ocean, contains vast reserves of carbon in Pleistocene!aged permafrost soils. Permafrost degradation, as a result of climate change, may cause shifts in riverine biogeochemistry as this old source of organic matter is exposed. Satellite remote sensing offers an opportunity to complement and extrapolate field sampling of dissolved organic matter in this expansive and remote region. We develop empirically based algorithms that estimate chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Kolyma River and its major tributaries in the vicinity of Cherskiy, Russia. Field samples from July 2008 and 2009 were regressed against spectral data from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper!Plus. A combination of Landsat band 3 and bands 2:1 resulted in an R2 of 0.78 between measured CDOM and satellite!derived predictions. Owing to the strong correlation between CDOM and DOC, the resulting maps of the region show strong interannual variability of both CDOM and DOC, and important spatial patterns such as mixing zones at river confluences and downstream loading of DOC. Such variability was previously unobserved through field!based point observations and suggests that current calculations of DOC flux from the Kolyma River to the Arctic Ocean may be underestimates. In this era of rapid climate change, permafrost degradation, and shifts in river discharge, remote sensing of CDOM and DOC offers a powerful, reliable tool to enhance our understanding of carbon cycling in major arctic river systems.

Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, picophytoeukaryotes and bacterioplankton abundances and contributions to the total particulate organic carbon concentration, derived from the total particle beam attenuation coefficient (cp), were determined across the eastern South Pacific between the Marquesas Islands and the coast of Chile. All flow cytometrically derived abundances decreased towards the hyper-oligotrophic centre of the gyre and were highest at the coast, except for Prochlorococcus, which was not detected under eutrophic conditions. Temperature and nutrient availability appeared important in modulating picophytoplankton abundance, according to the prevailing trophic conditions. Although the non-vegetal particles tended to dominate the cp signal everywhere along the transect (50 to 83\%), this dominance seemed to weaken from oligo- to eutrophic conditions, the contributions by vegetal and non-vegetal particles being about equal under mature upwelling conditions. Spatial variability in the vegetal compartment was more important than the non-vegetal one in shaping the water column particle beam attenuation coefficient. Spatial variability in picophytoplankton biomass could be traced by changes in both total chlorophyll a (i.e. mono + divinyl chlorophyll a) concentration and cp. Finally, picophytoeukaryotes contributed \textasciitilde 38\% on average to the total integrated phytoplankton carbon biomass or vegetal attenuation signal along the transect, as determined by size measurements (i.e. equivalent spherical diameter) on cells sorted by flow cytometry and optical theory. Although there are some uncertainties associated with these estimates, the new approach used in this work further supports the idea that picophytoeukaryotes play a dominant role in carbon cycling in the upper open ocean, even under hyper-oligotrophic conditions.},

The dataset includes 22 cloud-free Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images, as well as the nearly simultaneous in-situ observations from 15 stations on the lake. Compared to the general model used to estimate the Secchi Disk Transparency (SDT), a parameter for water clarity measurements, an improved model is developed, from the TM images. The results of these estimations are validated using the in-situ data by linear regression, and the accuracies are measured by the coefficient of determination R (2). The results reveal an indication of high model fit between the majority of SDT predictions and the in-situ observations. Also, the improved SDT model provides higher prediction accuracies than the general one when applied to 68.2\% (15 out of 22) of the images. The estimated clarity maps indicate that the turbid water is normally distributed at the nearshore areas and the northeastern region. Meanwhile, the southwestern lake has much clearer water than the other regions. In addition, the southern bay has always been suffering from a serious water quality problem even till now. The water clarity of Lake Simcoe shows strong seasonal patterns, that it is at its worst in August and September annually and much better in the other sampling seasons. On an overall scale, the lake water clarity kept relatively stable from 1987 until the fall of 1992, followed by a gradual increase until 2000, after a slight decrease, and lastly stayed consistent until the summer of 2008.},

One humic-like component was identified as representing terrestrial organic matter and showed a conservative behaviour in Hudson Bay estuaries. The second humic-like component, traditionally identified as peak M, originated both from land and produced in the marine environment. Component 3 had spectra resembling protein-like material and thought to be plankton-derived. The distribution and composition of CDOM were largely controlled by water mass mixing with protein-like component being the least affected. Distinctive fluorescence patterns were also found between Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, suggesting different sources of CDOM. The optically active fraction of DOC (both absorbing and fluorescing) was very high in the Hudson Bay (up to 89\%) suggesting that fluorescence and absorbance can be used as proxies of the DOC concentration. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {We explored various aspects of freshwater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) lability by comparing short-term ({$<$} 2 d) bacterial C consumption (STCC; derived from bacterial respiration measurements) with long-term (28 d) C consumption (LTCC) in DOC bioassays in lakes, rivers, and marshes located within the same complex drainage basin in southern Quebec. We also combined STCC and LTCC measurements to estimate the proportion of DOC removed, and to derive a first-order decay constant (k). STCC rates were, on average, 25\% higher than LTCC, and both parameters showed distinct patterns, reaching their lowest and highest values in lakes and marshes, respectively. STCC and LTCC were correlated to DOC concentration across these freshwater ecosystems, whereas in lakes, STCC was positively correlated to chlorophyll and LTCC to terrestrial C inputs. k showed no ecosystem-specific patterns but was negatively correlated to chlorophyll across systems. The size of the DOC pools supporting STCC and LTCC, as well as k, were related to distinct components of the DOC pool, as revealed by a parallel factor analysis of fluorescent dissolved organic matter excitation-emission spectra. Short-and long-term lability and C consumption, and the resulting k, are shown to be complementary facets of DOC bioavailability, which may play very different roles on aquatic ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Effect of permafrost degradation on grassland ecosystem has aroused interests in the scientists due to influence the processes of ecology in the permafrost regions of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. To gain insight into the contribution of permafrost degradation to the stability of grassland ecosystem, there is an urgent need to study the properties of grassland ecosystem in the succession stages due to degradation of frozen soil. A survey of plant vegetation was undertaken during 2003 and 2004 along the Qinghai-Tibetan Highway from Kunlunshan (94\textdegree 04' 46 ''E, 3538' 51' N) to the southern Tanggulashan Pass (33o07. 120'E,91\textdegree 52. 670'N), to study the properties of grassland ecosystem in the successional stages from marsh meadow, alpine meadow and steppe meadow to desert steppe due to permafrost degradation. Fifty-five spots were selected in the successional community series. Each plots were arranged with three replicates. In each subplot, all plant species present were counted, and coverage, height (50 plants) and frequency were recorded. Biomass was measured by harvesting and drying. The species diversity of the plant communities was calculated using the Shannon-Wiener (diversity) index (H), the Pielou (evenness) index (J), and richness index (Species number) (S). Three soil samplings at 0 -20 cm layer were collected to analysis the soil organic matter content. Soil water and temperate were measured. Accompanying by permafrost degradation, plant species in communities transferred from wet plants in marsh meadow to drought plants in desert steppe, and height and coverage of plant communities decreased, and the richness species index (S) was not significantly different among the successional communities series, whereas evenness index (J) and diversity index (H) were significantly different (P \textexclamdown 0.05), indicating that they first decreased and then increased, peaking in the steppe meadow. In the successional series resulted from permafrost degradation, biomass and carrying capacity generally decreased, however, they were not significantly different between alpine meadow and steppe meadow. Economic value of plants decreased, and weeds in plant communities increased in the sucessional series. Accompanying by the process of frozen soil degradation, soil temperate at 0-20 cm layers increased, however, soil moisture and soil organic matter reduced. These implied that permafrost degradation was disadvantageous to stability of grassland ecosystem in the permafrost regions of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.},

The CDOM concentrations (a(355)) of fresh end members in the Jiulong River Estuary varied seasonally, while its quality remained relatively stable. However, the a(355) of the marine end members exhibited less variability. Application of a conservative mixing model indicated that CDOM behaved conservatively in the Yangtze River Estuary. No photobleaching removal was observed at high salinity region of this estuary. Although CDOM showed conservative behavior for many cruises in the Jiulong River Estuary, there was evidence for removal in the low salinity regions during some cruises. Laboratory mixing experiments and a salt addition experiment suggested that particle sorption of CDOM maybe the possible reason for the removal. These results showed that absorption properties of CDOM can be used as a tool to observe the quantitative and qualitative dynamics of DOM during estuarine mixing. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Appropriate abatement actions require better knowledge of the governing factors for the increase, and this has motivated a growing scientific interest in understanding the factors and mechanisms promoting the CDOM increase. A proposed water color model for an important raw water source for Oslo, Norway, is based on the precipitation's amount and mobile ion concentration. The model explained more than 93\% of the temporal variation in CDOM between 1983 and 2008. The model structure was also tested on three adjacent raw water sources and was found to explain 75-82\% of the CDOM development throughout the same period. The long-term trend of increasing CDOM was closely related to the decline in sulfate and chloride concentrations in precipitation. Furthermore, interannual fluctuations in CDOM were explained by variation in predominant water flow paths, depending on amounts and intensity of precipitation, both of which are predicted to increase in several parts of the northern latitudes according to climate change scenarios.},

The impact of solar UV-B radiation is one potential stress factor that can have a negative impact on the health of certain species within these ecosystems. Although there is a paucity of data and information regarding the effect of UV-B radiation on total ecosystem structure and function\{,\} several recent studies have addressed the effects on various species within each trophic level. Climate change\{,\} acid deposition\{,\} and changes in other anthropogenic stressors such as pollutants alter UV exposure levels in inland and coastal marine waters. These factors potentially have important consequences for a variety of aquatic organisms including waterborne human pathogens. Recent results have demonstrated the negative impacts of exposure to UV-B radiation on primary producers\{,\} including effects on cyanobacteria\{,\} phytoplankton\{,\} macroalgae and aquatic plants. UV-B radiation is an environmental stressor for many aquatic consumers\{,\} including zooplankton\{,\} crustaceans\{,\} amphibians\{,\} fish\{,\} and corals. Many aquatic producers and consumers rely on avoidance strategies\{,\} repair mechanisms and the synthesis of UV-absorbing substances for protection. However\{,\} there has been relatively little information generated regarding the impact of solar UV-B radiation on species composition within natural ecosystems or on the interaction of organisms between trophic levels within those ecosystems. There remains the question as to whether a decrease in population size of the more sensitive primary producers would be compensated for by an increase in the population size of more tolerant species\{,\} and therefore whether there would be a net negative impact on the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by these ecosystems. Another question is whether there would be a significant impact on the quantity and quality of nutrients cycling through the food web\{,\} including the generation of food proteins for humans. Interactive effects of UV radiation with changes in other stressors\{,\} including climate change and pollutants\{,\} are likely to be particularly important.},

  abstract = {Microalgae colonizing the underside of sea ice in spring are a key component of the Arctic foodweb as they drive early primary production and transport of carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean interior. Onset of the spring bloom of ice algae is typically limited by the availability of light, and the current consensus is that a few tens-of-centimeters of snow is enough to prevent sufficient solar radiation to reach underneath the sea ice. We challenge this consensus, and investigated the onset and the light requirement of an ice algae spring bloom, and the importance of snow optical properties for light penetration. Colonization by ice algae began in May under {$>$}1 m of first-year sea ice with approximate to 1 m thick snow cover on top, in NE Greenland. The initial growth of ice algae began at extremely low irradiance ({$<$}0.17 mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and was documented as an increase in Chlorophyll a concentration, an increase in algal cell number, and a viable photosynthetic activity. Snow thickness changed little during May (from 110 to 91 cm), however the snow temperature increased steadily, as observed from automated high-frequency temperature profiles. We propose that changes in snow optical properties, caused by temperature-driven snow metamorphosis, was the primary driver for allowing sufficient light to penetrate through the thick snow and initiate algae growth below the sea ice. This was supported by radiative-transfer modeling of light attenuation. Implications are an earlier productivity by ice algae in Arctic sea ice than recognized previously.},

The size of the reservoir as well as its positions as a sink for auto-trophically fixed carbon and as a source of substrate to microbial heterotrophs indicates that \{DOC\} plays a central role in the ocean carbon cycle. But what is this role, how is it realized, and what are its mechanisms and controls. The fundamentals of these questions have remained unchanged over the past 40 years and continue to challenge the ocean carbon research community today. A considerable amount of financial and intellectual capital has been expended and significant progress has been made over the past decade. In this chapter, the role of \{DOC\} in the ocean carbon cycle is considered in its broadest temporal and spatial scales. The chapter evaluates the spatial distribution of \{DOC\} at the regional and basin scales in both the surface and deep ocean.},

  abstract = {Recent literature has suggested that for many lakes and rivers, the respiratory breakdown of organic matter (R) exceeds production of organic matter by photosynthesis (gross primary production [GPP]) within the water body. This metabolic balance (GPP {$<$} R; "heterotrophy") implies that allochthonous organic matter supports a portion of the aquatic ecosystem's respiration. Evidence that many lakes are heterotrophic comes from diverse approaches, and debate remains over the circumstances in which heterotrophy exists. The methods used to estimate GPP and R and the limited extent of take types studied, especially with respect to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, are two reasons for differing conclusions. We deployed O-2 and CO2 sondes to measure diel gas dynamics in the surface waters of 25 takes. From these data, we calculated GPP, R, and net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP - R). Over the broad range in TP and DOC among the lakes, diel CO2 and O-2 changed on a near 1 : 1 molar ratio. Metabolism estimates from the two gases were comparable, except at high pH. Most lakes in our data set had negative NEP, but GPP and R appeared to be controlled by different factors. TP correlated strongly with GPP, whereas DOC correlated with R. At low DOC concentrations, GPP and R were nearly equal, but, at higher DOC, GPP and R uncoupled and lakes had negative NEP Strong correlations between lake metabolism and landscape related variables suggest that allochthonous carbon influences lake metabolism.},

Using experiments performed in high-latitude Siberia and in temperate Sweden, we show for the first time that, among freshwater crustacean zooplankton, the defense against threats from ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a system where phenotypic plasticity and behavioral escape mechanisms function as complementary traits. Freshwater copepods relied mainly on accumulating protective pigments when exposed to UV radiation, but Daphnia showed strong behavioral responses. Pigment levels for both Daphnia and copepods were generally higher at higher latitudes, mirroring different UV threat levels. When released from the UV threat, Daphnia rapidly reduced (within 10 days) their UV protecting pigmentation-by as much as 40\%\textendash suggesting a cost in maintaining UV protective pigmentation. The evolutionary advantage of protective pigments is, likely, the ability to utilize the whole water column during daytime; conversely, since the amount of algal food is generally higher in surface waters, unpigmented individuals are restricted to a less preferred feeding habitat in deeper waters. Our main conclusion is that different zooplankton taxa, and similar taxa at different latitudes, use different mixes of behavior and pigments to respond to UV radiation.},

  abstract = {In this report, we provide a perspective on how zooplankton are able to respond to present and future levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a threat that has been present throughout evolutionary time. To cope with this threat, zooplankton have evolved several adaptations including behavioral responses, repair systems, and accumulation of photoprotective compounds. Common photoprotective compounds include melanins and carotenoids, which are true pigments, but also mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and several other substances, and different taxa use different blends of these compounds. It is not only the level of UV radiation, however, that determines the amount of photoprotective compounds incorporated by the zooplankton, but also other environmental factors, such as predation and supply rate of the compounds. Furthermore, compared to taxa that are less pigmented, those taxa with ample pigmentation are generally less likely to exhibit diel migration. The photoenzymatic repair of UV damages seems to be more efficient at intermediate temperature than at low and high temperatures, suggesting that it is less useful at high and low latitudes, where UV radiation is often extremely high. While predicted future increases in UV radiation are expected to substantially affect many processes, recent studies show that most zooplankton taxa are well adapted to cope with such increases, either by UV avoidance behavior or by incorporation of photoprotective compounds. Hence, we conclude that future increase in UV radiation will have only moderate direct effects on zooplankton biomass and community dynamics.},

We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.},

In contrast, it is shown that an extension of Cattell's principle of rotation to Proportional Profiles (PP) offers a basis for determining explanatory factors for three-way or higher order multi-mode data. Conceptual models are developed for two basic patterns of multi-mode data variation, system- and object-variation, and PP analysis is found to apply in the system-variation case. Although PP was originally formulated as a principle of rotation to be used with classic two-way factor analysis, it is shown to embody a latent three-mode factor model, which is here made explicit and generalized frown two to N "parallel occasions". As originally formulated, PP rotation was restricted to orthogonal factors. The generalized PP model is demonstrated to give unique "correct" solutions with oblique, non-simple structure, and even non-linear factor structures. A series of tests, conducted with synthetic data of known factor composition, demonstrate the capabilities of linear and non-linear versions of the model, provide data on the minimal necessary conditions of uniqueness, and reveal the properties of the analysis procedures when these minimal conditions are not fulfilled. In addition, a mathematical proof is presented for the uniqueness of the solution given certain conditions on the data. Three-mode PP factor analysis is applied to a three-way set of real data consisting of the fundamental and first three formant frequencies of 11 persons saying 8 vowels. A unique solution is extracted, consisting of three factors which are highly meaningful and consistent with prior knowledge and theory concerning vowel quality. The relationships between the three-mode PP model and Tucker's multi-modal model, McDonald's non-linear model and Carroll and Chang's multi-dimensional scaling model are explored.}

We emphasize that this definition of chaos can include the effects of noise, and that there is no dichotomy between stochasticity and chaos. We review three classes of approaches for studying chaos in ecology: models, analysis of time series, and experiments. Current ideas from modelling approaches demonstrate the plausibility of chaos. New approaches for analyzing time series are based on using the presence of a positive Lvapunov exponent to indicate sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The methods can deal with relatively short time series that include the effects of noise, with chaotic dynamics appearing in at least some cases. Experimental work is just beginning, spurred by modelling results and the new methods for analyzing times series. We suggest directions tor further work in each of these approaches.}

However, recent work has emphasized the importance of transient dynamics rather than long-term behavior in ecological systems, enabling the examination of forces that allow coexistence on ecological timescales. Through an examination of what leads to transients in ecological systems, a deeper appreciation of the forces leading to persistence or coexistence in ecological systems emerges, as well as a general understanding of how population levels can change through time.},

The oceanographic community's perception of \{DOM\} has evolved from an emphasis on a dilute and largely separate pool of remarkably old and static substances to the current view of a dynamic assemblage of organic molecules that interact with each other, trace metals, and living organisms over a broad continuum of space and time scales. The sparingly reactive components of this molecular continuum that persist and change on time scales sampled by conventional oceanographic surveys represent a small molecular outcrop of a churning mass of molecules through which much of the total primary production of the ocean cycles.},

Such models are a special case of species distribution models in which the current geographical distribution of species is related to climatic variables so to enable projections of distributions under future climate change scenarios. This work reviews a number of critical methodological issues that may lead to uncertainty in predictions from bioclimatic modelling. Particular attention is paid to recent developments of bioclimatic modelling that address some of these issues as well as to the topics where more progress needs to be made. Developing and applying bioclimatic models in a informative way requires good understanding of a wide range of methodologies, including the choice of modelling technique, model validation, collinearity, autocorrelation, biased sampling of explanatory variables, scaling and impacts of non-climatic factors. A key challenge for future research is integrating factors such as land cover, direct CO(2) effects, biotic interactions and dispersal mechanisms into species-climate models. We conclude that, although bioclimatic envelope models have a number of important advantages, they need to be applied only when users of models have a thorough understanding of their limitations and uncertainties.},

Size-exclusion chromatography, in combination with absorbance and emission matrix fluorometry, was applied to assess how agricultural land use alters the amount and composition of DOM, as well as dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) forms in headwater streams, including temporal variations, in a temperate region of NE Germany. By comparing six agriculturally and six forest-impacted headwater streams, we demonstrated that agriculture promotes increased DOC and DON concentrations, entailing an even more pronounced effect on DON. The major part of DOC and DON in agricultural and forest reference streams is exported in the form of humic-like material with high molecular weight, which indicates terrestrial, i.e., allochthonous sources. As an obvious difference in agricultural streams, the contribution of DOC and particularly DON occurring in the form of nonhumic high-molecular-weight, presumably proteinous material is clearly elevated. Altogether, DOM in agricultural headwaters is mainly complex-soil-derived and aromatic material with a low C:N ratio, which is more microbial processed than its counterpart from forest reference catchments. Our results emphasize the importance of agricultural land use on DOM loss from soils and identify agricultural soils as important DOC and particularly DON sources to headwater streams. \ding{110} INTRODUCTION Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents the largest pool of reduced carbon in the biosphere and is a heterogeneous mixture of several thousand various dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) forms. Because the DOM composition is a key property determining its bioavailability, 1-3 changes of the DOM composition in streams can have far-reaching effects on the whole stream ecosystem. Recent findings indicate that soil organic matter (SOM) persistence is determined more by environmental conditions than by the intrinsic properties of the SOM. 4 Because of tillage, ploughing, and fertilization, agricultural land use substantially alters environmental conditions in soils, results in qualitative changes of SOM, stimulation of SOM turnover, and microbial decomposition, and induces the release of organic matter (OM) previously protected in soil aggregates. 5-7 Headwater streams intimately connect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, whereby catchment soils and vegetation constitute the main source of DOM. 8 Consequently, alterations of catchment characteristics potentially propagate to stream DOM compo-sition. 9 Knowing the effects of agricultural land use on the DOM composition and the forms and concentrations of DOC and DON in headwater streams is important for water resource management because small headwater streams markedly influence the downstream water quality 10 and dominate stream length, with it riparian zones at the global scale.},

To examine the qualitative changes to DOM optical properties during photobleaching, 674. m N. Pacific DOM, concentrated and desalted by reverse osmosis with electrodialysis (RO/ED), was subjected to 68. days of continuous irradiation in a UV solar simulator. Approximately 84\% of chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM respectively) and 38\% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were lost during the irradiation. Based on these results the concentration of photochemically refractory DOC in the surface pacific is estimated to be 27??mol of carbon per liter. In addition, the spectra of the remaining CDOM and FDOM were shifted towards shorter wavelengths, a result which has important implications for the interpretation of fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra because the relative positions of fluorescence maxima are often attributed to differences in FDOM source.

  abstract = {To investigate the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a function of apparent molecular weight (MW) by rapid analytical methods, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was conducted with sequential on-line detectors consisting of UV, fluorescence, and quantitative DOC measurement. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectrophotometry was used to select wavelengths for the HPSEC on-line fluorescence system. The chosen peak maxima locations of excitation-emission wavelengths were 278-353 nm for protein-like substances and 337-423 nm for fulvic-like substances based on an analysis of EEM spectra for various samples and reference materials. This system provides quantitative and qualitative information on the specific MW components of DOM, including proportion of DOC (by DOC measurement), aromaticity (by comparison of UV and DOC measurements), and chemical properties (by fluorescence measurement). It further allows determination of organic matter characteristics (e.g., fulvic-like, protein-like, and polysaccharide-like substances) as a function of MW. Three types of samples (Irvine Ranch ground water (IRWD-GW), Barr Lake surface water (BL-SW), and Hawaii wastewater secondary effluent) were analyzed by the HPSEC-UVA-fluorescence-DOC system. These results were compared with fluorescence EEM for samples fractionated by HPLC-SEC. The DOM fraction in the high apparent MW range (over 10,000g/mol) consisted of polysaccharide-like substances for IRWD-GW and a mixture of polysaccharide-like/protein-like substances for BL-SW and wastewater secondary effluent. Minimal amounts of fulvic-like substances were found in the wastewater secondary effluent sample. The DOM fractions in a medium apparent MW range (5000-1000 g/M) showed higher aromaticity (fulvic in character) than any other fractions for all samples. For the DOM fraction in the low apparent MW range (below 680 g/M), additional aliphatic organic matter was found in IRWD-GW, while BL-SW contained protein-like processes. DOM plays an important role in drinking water and wastewater treatment processes. An enhanced HPSEC technique with multiple on-line detectors enables a better understanding of quantitative and qualitative DOM properties and can help to design and optimize water/wastewater treatment facilities.},

Here we report the fractionation of lignin phenols both during solubilization from plant litters and again during sorption of resulting leachates to soils. Source parameters in both leached and sorbed lignin varied from the parent litters by as much as ten-fold, while elevated lignin oxidation parameters in riverine dissolved OM ( DOM) can be completely explained by dissolution and sorption. Carbon-normalized dissolved lignin endmembers indicate a substantial fraction of riverine DOM may not be vascular plant-derived, and thus derived from algal, microbial or non-vascular plant sources such as mosses. These results demonstrate that riverine DOM is less degraded and likely more labile than previously thought, and helps resolve the paradox of diagenetically-altered riverine DOM degrading rapidly in marine systems.},

  abstract = {Willow Slough, a seasonally irrigated agricultural watershed in the Sacramento River valley, California, was sampled weekly in 2006 in order to investigate seasonal concentrations and compositions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Average DOC concentrations nearly doubled from winter baseflow (2.75 mg L-1) to summer irrigation (5.14 mg L-1), while a concomitant increase in carbon-normalized vanillyl phenols (0.11 mg 100 mg OC-1 increasing to 0.31 mg 100 mg OC-1, on average) indicates that this additional carbon is likely vascular plant-derived. A strong linear relationship between lignin concentration and total suspended sediments (r2 = 0.79) demonstrates that agricultural management practices that mobilize sediments will likely have a direct and significant impact on DOC composition. The original source of vascular plant-derived DOC to Willow Slough appears to be the same throughout the year as evidenced by similar syringyl to vanillyl and cinnamyl to vanillyl ratios. However, differing diagenetic pathways during winter baseflow as compared to the rest of the year are evident in acid to aldehyde ratios of both vanillyl and syringyl phenols. The chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 350 nm showed a strong correlation with lignin concentration (r2 = 0.83). Other CDOM measurements related to aromaticity and molecular weight also showed correlations with carbon-normalized yields (e.g. specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (r2 = 0.57) and spectral slope (r2 = 0.54)). Our overall findings suggest that irrigated agricultural watersheds like Willow Slough can potentially have a significant impact on mainstem DOC concentration and composition when scaled to the entire watershed of the main tributary. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

Part of this can be accredited experimental condition and stage or condition of the tested organisms, but it does probably also reflect a real difference in UVR susceptibility among taxa and species. Adaptations such as vertical migration or the presence of UVR protective pigments suggest a major need for UV-protection in arctic and alpine localities. Thus alpine and arctic freshwaters communities are evolutionary shaped towards tolerance to a variety of challenges including high exposure to UVR. These evolutionary adaptations of behaviour, pigmentation and enzymes reflects the organisms? past experience with UV. Such adaptations clearly have their costs, yet such costs may be quite subtle and hard to detect.},

Seasonal integrated primary production (IPP) across the PAR was calculated from 524 profiles, 340 of which were also analyzed to determine the average vertical distribution of PP rates for spring, summer and fall months. The Chirikov Basin and Chukchi Shelf were the most productive areas, with the East Siberian Sea, Chukchi Plateau and Canada Basin the lowest. Decadal-scale changes were indicated in the southern Chukchi Sea, and across Hanna Shoal. In the southern Chukchi Sea in August, IPP increased significantly from 113{$\pm$}35mgCm-2 d-1 in 1959 and 1960 to 833{$\pm$}307mgCm-2 d-1 in the 2000s. Increases in the magnitude of IPP were accompanied by variations in the vertical distribution, the subsurface peak observed in the 1959/60 was not present in the 2000s. The mechanism behind this change was undetermined but could have included changes in stratification, mixing or surface distribution of water masses as well as methodological differences. Over Hanna Shoal, the phytoplankton surface bloom now occurs earlier by several weeks compared to 1993, linked to increases in light due to earlier sea- ice retreat. In 1993 with sea ice still present in the region the surface bloom occurred in August, in 2002 and 2004 this same period was characterized by open water and low surface PP and strong subsurface production. This dataset provides a region-wide quantification of IPP and decadal trends and highlights the need for a cooperative monitoring program to observe the long-term impacts of climate change in the Arctic ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Shallow, small-sized, macrophyte-dominated lakes are frequently inserted into the upstream, initial sections of low-grade river systems in post-glacial lowland landscapes. In terms of the River Continuum Concept they function as 'disturbing inserts' which are: 1. sinks for transported nitrate nitrogen by providing more sites for effective denitrification (anoxic, organic sediments, vegetation beds), 2. usually sink also for total phosphorus fluvial load except in summer periods when the net export of this nutrient takes place due to internal loading, being the source of it for downstream river section, 3. transform the coarse, low-organic fluvial suspended matter into the subtle, rich-organic suspension in which living plankton organisms are present. One can say that these lakes being a stagnant section of a system, are shortening the length of nutrient spiralling within the river ecosystem. The fluvial lakes increase the patchiness of a river system providing the sites for aquatic vegetation patches and sediment patches more stable in relation to typical river conditions; in this way, they enlarge the area of refuges in a river system. The greater the refugial area in a system the more stabilised are the predator (fish) - prey (invertebrates) relations in the river food web. The inflows (deltas) as well as outflows from the lake are important sites for the transformation of fluvial matter and nutrients, as well as for river habitat patchiness. The lakes inserted into the fluvial system thus provide the examples of the Serial Discontinuity analogical to the man-made impoundments on a large river system.},

Empirical models were constructed by correlating the strongest within-year, among-lake trends in species abundance with the strongest among- lake trends in abiotic variables determined by principal coordinates analyses; indices of nearshore vegetation cover were also used as predictor variables.

Using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), three DOM fluorophores were identified. One fluorophore, previously identified as peak C, was of allochthonous (component 1) origin and two previously uncharacterized fluorophores were identified as autochthonous (components 2 and 3). Component 1 was photoreactive and the dominant form in creek water samples while components 2 and 3 were dominant in Hamilton Harbour and lake water samples. Components 2 and 3 showed limited photoreactivity. Exposure to full spectrum irradiance decreased the average molecular weight of DOM (i.e., increased the absorbance ratio (a254:a365)) for all water samples. DOM bioavailability was lowest in creek and highest in lake water samples and was inversely related to DOM average molecular weight. Photomodification of DOM resulted in higher bacterial activity although these differences were not significantly different. This suggests that light plays a significant role in the cycling of terrestrially-derived DOM and to a certain extent autochthonous DOM, potentially increasing metabolism of both terrestrially and microbially derived DOM in the Great Lakes aquatic ecosystems.},

Based on 55 samples. PARAFAC identified three individual fluorophore moieties, which were attributed to humic-like, fulvic-like, and protein-like materials. The categorization of these seemingly universal fluorophore moieties in aqueous systems was consistent with expected analyte concentrations that were independently measured by traditional wet chemistry techniques. The relative distribution of the three fluorophore fractions varied among the different land use catchments, especially in locations of known anthropogenic activity. Distinctive relationships between the fulvic-like and protein-like materials were observed for catchments known to be influenced by anthropogenic activity and those believed to reflect more natural environments, suggesting that this technique could be used to monitor human impact on aquatic systems. Finally, PAR-AFAC can be used to provide estimates (+/- 30\%) of select analyte concentrations in surface water. The results of this study support the use of EEM and PAR-AFAC analyses by watershed managers and other personnel interested in understanding organic matter behavior in aquatic systems.

Unfortunately, the commonly used indophenol blue method often yields inconsistent results, particularly when ammonium concentrations are low. Here, we present a fluorometric method that gives precise measurements of ammonium over a wide range of concentrations and salinities emphasizing submicromolar levels. The procedure not only solves analytical problems but also substantially simplifies sample collection and preservation. It uses a single working reagent (consisting of orthophthaldialdehyde, sodium sulfite, and sodium borate) that is stable for months when stored in the dark. The working reagent and sample can be mixed immediately after sample collection and the reaction proceeds to completion within 3 h at room temperature. Matrix effects and background fluorescence can be corrected without introducing substantial error. This simple method produces highly reproducible results even at very low ammonium concentrations.}

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important vehicle for the movement of nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic systems. To investigate how the source and composition of aquatic DOM change in both space and time, we used chemical, spectroscopic, and isotopic analyses to characterize DOM in a headwater catchment in the Colorado Front Range. Streamwater samples for DOM analyses were collected from 2 sites, a lightly vegetated alpine site and a forested, subalpine site, in the North Boulder Creek catchment during the snowmelt runoff season (May-September). Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) peaked on the ascending limb of the snowmelt hydrograph at both the alpine (2.6 mg C l(-1)) and the subalpine sites (7.0 mg C l(-1)) and decreased sharply on the descending, limb of the hydrograph. Fractionation of DOM into operationally defined humic and non-humic components showed that the fulvic acid content of DOC decreased through the season at both sites and that spectroscopic (fluorescence and ultraviolet) properties of the humic DOM fraction shifted in a manner consistent with an increase in the proportion of humic DOM derived from instream sources as compared to terrestrial catchment sources. Humic and non-humic fractions of DOM isolated near peak flow in June and during low flows in September showed a seasonal enrichment in N-15 and C-13 as well as a seasonal decrease in the ratio of aromatic to aliphatic carbon, both of which were correlated with a decrease in the C:N ratio of the DOM fractions. These results suggest that seasonal shifts in the isotopic and chemical characteristics of DOM are a result of changes in catchment sources of DOM. In particular, it appears that DOM production in alpine lakes is an important contributor to the streamwater DOM load during late season low flows, especially in the alpine reach of the catchment. Our results further suggest that stable isotopes of C and N are useful tools, particularly when combined with ancillary data such as elemental analyses and catchment discharge, for evaluating sources and transformations of DOM at the catchment scale.},

Climate-driven changes to glacier runoff are expected to be larger than climate impacts on other components of the hydrological cycle, and may represent an important flux of organic carbon. A compilation of published data on dissolved organic carbon from glaciers across five continents reveals that mountain and polar glaciers represent a quantitatively important store of organic carbon. The Antarctic Ice Sheet is the repository of most of the roughly 6 petagrams (Pg) of organic carbon stored in glacier ice, but the annual release of glacier organic carbon is dominated by mountain glaciers in the case of dissolved organic carbon and the Greenland Ice Sheet in the case of particulate organic carbon. Climate change contributes to these fluxes: approximately 13\% of the annual flux of glacier dissolved organic carbon is a result of glacier mass loss. These losses are expected to accelerate, leading to a cumulative loss of roughly 15 teragrams (Tg) of glacial dissolved organic carbon by 2050 due to climate change \textemdash{} equiva- lent to about half of the annual flux of dissolved organic carbon from the Amazon River. Thus, glaciers constitute a key link between terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes, and will be of increasing importance in land-to-ocean fluxes of organic carbon in glacierized regions.},

The field samples were collected primarily from eutrophic waters, although mesotrophic waters were also sampled to create a dynamic range in chlorophyll concentration spanning approximately two orders of magnitude (0.3-25.8 mg m-3). The intercomparisons were used to establish the following: a) the uncertainties in quantitating individual pigments and higher-order variables (sums, ratios, and indices); b) an evaluation of spectrophotometric versus HPLC uncertainties in the determination of total chlorophyll a; and c) the reduction in uncertainties as a result of applying quality assurance (QA) procedures associated with extraction, separation, injection, degradation, detection, calibration, and reporting (particularly limits of detection and quantitation). In addition, the remote sensing requirements for the in situ determination of total chlorophyll a were investigated to determine whether or not the average uncertainty for this measurement is being satisfied. The culmination of the activity was a validation of the round-robin methodology plus the development of the requirements for validating an individual HPLC method. The validation process includes the measurements required to initially demonstrate a pigment is validated, and the measurements that must be made during sample analysis to confirm a method remains validated. The so-called performance-based metrics developed here describe a set of thresholds for a variety of easily-measured parameters with a corresponding set of performance categories. The aggregate set of performance parameters and categories establish a) the overall performance capability of the method, and b) whether or not the capability is consistent with the required accuracy objectives.}

  abstract = {Abstract. A next-generation in-water profiler designed to measure the apparent optical properties (AOPs) of seawater was developed and validated across a wide dynamic range of in-water properties. The new free-falling instrument, the Compact-Optical Profiling System (C-OPS), was based on sensors built with a cluster of 19 state-of-the-art microradiometers spanning 320\textendash 780 nm and a novel kite-shaped backplane. The new backplane includes tunable ballast, a hydrobaric buoyancy chamber, plus pitch and roll adjustments, to provide unprecedented stability and vertical resolution in near-surface waters. A unique data set was collected as part of the development activity plus the first major field campaign that used the new instrument, the Malina expedition to the Beaufort Sea in the vicinity of the Mackenzie River outflow. The data were of sufficient resolution and quality to show that errors \textendash{} more correctly, uncertainties \textendash{} in the execution of data sampling protocols were measurable at the 1\% and 1 cm level with C-OPS. A theoretical sensitivity analysis as a function of three water types established by the peak in the remote sensing reflectance spectrum, Rrs({$\lambda$}), revealed which water types and which parts of the spectrum were the most sensitive to data acquisition uncertainties. Shallow riverine waters were the most sensitive water type, and the ultraviolet and near-infrared spectral end members, which are critical to next-generation satellite missions, were the most sensitive parts of the spectrum. The sensitivity analysis also showed how the use of data products based on band ratios significantly mitigated the influence of data acquisition uncertainties. The unprecedented vertical resolution provided high-quality data products, which supported an alternative classification capability based on the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient, Kd({$\lambda$}). The Kd(320) and Kd(780) data showed how complex coastal systems can be distinguished two-dimensionally and how near-ice water masses are different from the neighboring open ocean. Finally, an algorithm for predicting the spectral absorption due to colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), denoted aCDOM({$\lambda$}), was developed using the Kd(320) / Kd(780) ratio, which was based on a linear relationship with respect to aCDOM(440). The robustness of the approach was established by expanding the use of the algorithm to include a geographically different coastal environment, the Southern Mid-Atlantic Bight, with no significant change in accuracy (approximately 98\% of the variance explained). Alternative spectral end members reminiscent of next-generation (340 and 710 nm) as well as legacy satellite missions (412 and 670 nm) were also used to accurately derive aCDOM(440) from Kd({$\lambda$}) ratios.}

  abstract = {Abstract. This study establishes an optical inversion scheme for deriving the absorption coefficient of colored (or chromophoric, depending on the literature) dissolved organic material (CDOM) at the 440 nm wavelength, which can be applied to global water masses with near-equal efficacy. The approach uses a ratio of diffuse attenuation coefficient spectral end-members, i.e., a short- and long-wavelength pair. The global perspective is established by sampling ``extremely'' clear water plus a generalized extent in turbidity and optical properties that each span 3 decades of dynamic range. A unique data set was collected in oceanic, coastal, and inland waters (as shallow as 0.6 m) from the North Pacific Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, Hawaii, Japan, Puerto Rico, and the western coast of the United States. The data were partitioned using subjective categorizations to define a validation quality subset of conservative water masses (i.e., the inflow and outflow of properties constrain the range in the gradient of a constituent) plus 15 subcategories of more complex water masses that were not necessarily evolving conservatively. The dependence on optical complexity was confirmed with an objective methodology based on a cluster analysis technique. The latter defined five distinct classes with validation quality data present in all classes, but which also decreased in percent composition as a function of increasing class number and optical complexity. Four algorithms based on different validation quality end-members were validated with accuracies of 1.2 \%\textendash 6.2 \%, wherein pairs with the largest spectral span were most accurate. Although algorithm accuracy decreased with the inclusion of more subcategories containing nonconservative water masses, changes to the algorithm fit were small when a preponderance of subcategories were included. The high accuracy for all end-member algorithms was the result of data acquisition and data processing improvements, e.g., increased vertical sampling resolution to less than 1 mm (with pressure transducer precision of 0.03\textendash 0.08 mm) and a boundary constraint to mitigate wave-focusing effects, respectively. An independent evaluation with a historical database confirmed the consistency of the algorithmic approach and its application to quality assurance, e.g., to flag data outside expected ranges, identify suspect spectra, and objectively determine the in-water extrapolation interval by converging agreement for all applicable end-member algorithms. The legacy data exhibit degraded performance (as 44 \% uncertainty) due to a lack of high-quality near-surface observations, especially for clear waters wherein wave-focusing effects are problematic. The novel optical approach allows the in situ estimation of an in-water constituent in keeping with the accuracy obtained in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {Optimal escape theory can successfully explain variation in the distance to an approaching predator at which prey initiate flight (the flight initiation distance, FID). However, for animals without access to refuges, optimal escape theory may also explain variation in the distance that prey flee (the retreat distance, RD). In benthic stream habitats, both the risk of predation and the costs of escape may be mediated by water velocity; optimal escape theory then predicts that FID and RD of slow-current insects should vary little with increasing current velocity, whereas the FID and RD of fast-current insects should decrease. To test this prediction, a simulated predator (SP) was used to initiate escape responses in 3 mayflies found in different habitats-Ameletus (slow pools), Baetis (fast riffles), and Epeorus (very fast cascades)-across a range of water velocities. Unexpectedly, the FID of all 3 prey did not vary with water velocity. In contrast, the RD of Epeorus decreased with velocity (RD at the lowest velocity about 4.5x greater than the highest velocity), whereas the RD of Ameletus did not vary significantly with velocity. Escape behaviors of Baetis did not vary strongly with velocity. Variation in the proportion of larvae that escaped by drifting or swimming rather than crawling (Ameletus {$>$} Baetis, Epeorus) suggests that for fast-current prey, the costs associated with leaving the streambed exceed the risks of benthic predation. Water velocity may thus influence ecological processes such as predator-prey interactions and emigration from patches in substantial, but previously unexplored, ways.},

Stormwater DOM was also analysed in relation to storm event characteristics, water quality and spectroscopic analysis. Statistical tools were used to determine the correlations within DOM and water quality measurements. Results showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) as conventional DOM parameters were found to be correlated well to the changes in stormwater quality during each of the three storm events studied. Both detector wavelengths (210 and 254 nm) and their ratio (A210/A254) were found to provide additional information on the physiochemical properties of stormwater-associated DOM. This study indicated that A210/A254 is an important parameter which could be used to estimate the DOM proportions of functional groups and conjugated carbon species. This study provided also an understanding of stormwater quality constituents through assessing variability and sensitivity for various parameters, and the additional information of rainfall characteristics on runoff quality data for a better understanding of parameter correlations and influences.},

Seasonal changes in plankton composition and biomass were more important than those resulting from differences in water mass (tributary) of origin. Sampling at three cross river sections and in two fluvial lakes showed a progressive downstream decrease in phytoplankton biomass and changes in size structure and taxonomic composition. River plankton was primarily composed of small ({$<$} 10 mu m equivalent spherical diameter), truly planktonic cells belonging to Cryptophyceae and diatoms, with Chlorophyceae in summer. Plankton sampled in summer among rooted macrophytes in fluvial lakes exhibited a higher biomass of resuspended periphytic algae than in the main river stem, which contributed slightly to downstream phytoplankton biomass. Successive river cross sections always shared about 50\% of their taxa, indicating a rapid downstream transport of algae within the main water mass. However, the proportion of species common to all cross sections was highest during the spring freshet, and lowest during summer low discharge, likely resulting from the development of a distinct flora in fluvial lakes during summer. Conversely, about 30\% of the identified taxa were exclusive to a cross section and were replaced by others occurring downstream. Overall, phytoplankton composition along the St.Lawrence River is primarily controlled by advective forces, which result in a homogeneous flora in the main river stem, with a local contribution of resuspended periphyton from fluvial lakes.},

Exposure of new substrate during periods of extreme low water levels may facilitate the invasion of aggressive and (or) exotic species. In Lake Saint-Pierre, a strong negative relationship was observed between seasonal water level and the percentage of emergent plant cover. Under low water levels, the lake becomes a large (387 km2) marshland that could support a high plant biomass (286 times 103 t) whereas under high water levels, the lake shifts to a vast (501 km2) open-water body with a lower predicted plant biomass (117 times 103 t). A model of the major anthropic and climatic forces acting on water levels is also presented; it describes aquatic plant biomass allocation and species diversity under different water level conditions.},

  abstract = {Soils and other unconsolidated deposits in the northern circumpolar permafrost region store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). This SOC is potentially vulnerable to remobilization following soil warming and permafrost thaw, but SOC stock estimates were poorly constrained and quantitative error estimates were lacking. This study presents revised estimates of permafrost SOC stocks, including quantitative uncertainty estimates, in the 0-3 m depth range in soils as well as for sediments deeper than 3 m in deltaic deposits of major rivers and in the Yedoma region of Siberia and Alaska. Revised estimates are based on significantly larger databases compared to previous studies. Despite this there is evidence of significant remaining regional data gaps. Estimates remain particularly poorly constrained for soils in the High Arctic region and physiographic regions with thin sedimentary overburden (mountains, highlands and plateaus) as well as for deposits below 3 m depth in deltas and the Yedoma region. While some components of the revised SOC stocks are similar in magnitude to those previously reported for this region, there are substantial differences in other components, including the fraction of perennially frozen SOC. Upscaled based on regional soil maps, estimated permafrost region SOC stocks are 217 {$\pm$} 12 and 472 {$\pm$} 27 Pg for the 0-0.3 and 0-1 m soil depths, respectively ({$\pm$}95\% confidence intervals). Storage of SOC in 0-3 m of soils is estimated to 1035 {$\pm$} 150 Pg. Of this, 34 {$\pm$} 16 Pg C is stored in poorly developed soils of the High Arctic. Based on generalized calculations, storage of SOC below 3 m of surface soils in deltaic alluvium of major Arctic rivers is estimated as 91 {$\pm$} 52 Pg. In the Yedoma region, estimated SOC stocks below 3 m depth are 181 {$\pm$} 54 Pg, of which 74 {$\pm$} 20 Pg is stored in intact Yedoma (late Pleistocene ice- and organic-rich silty sediments) with the remainder in refrozen thermokarst deposits. Total estimated SOC storage for the permafrost region is \&sim;1300 Pg with an uncertainty range of \&sim;1100 to 1500 Pg. Of this, \&sim;500 Pg is in non-permafrost soils, seasonally thawed in the active layer or in deeper taliks, while \&sim;800 Pg is perennially frozen. This represents a substantial \&sim;300 Pg lowering of the estimated perennially frozen SOC stock compared to previous estimates.}

  abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that CO(2) supersaturation along the aquatic conduit over Sweden can be explained by processes other than aquatic respiration. A first generalized-additive model (GAM) analysis evaluating the relationships between single water chemistry variables and pCO(2) in lakes and streams revealed that water chemistry variables typical for groundwater input, e.g., dissolved silicate (DSi) and Mg2+ had explanatory power similar to total organic carbon (TOC). Further GAM analyses on various lake size classes and stream orders corroborated the slightly higher explanatory power for DSi in lakes and Mg2+ for streams compared with TOC. Both DSi and TOC explained 22-46\% of the pCO(2) variability in various lake classes (0.01-{$>$} 100 km2) and Mg2+ and TOC explained 11-41\% of the pCO(2) variability in the various stream orders. This suggests that aquatic pCO(2) has a strong groundwater signature. Terrestrial respiration is a significant source of the observed supersaturation and we may assume that both terrestrial respiration and aquatic respiration contributed equally to pCO(2) efflux. pCO(2) and TOC concentrations decreased with lake size suggesting that the longer water residence time allow greater equilibration of CO(2) with the atmosphere and in-lake mineralization of TOC. For streams, we observed a decreasing trend in pCO(2) with stream orders between 3 and 6. We calculated the total CO(2) efflux from all Swedish lakes and streams to be 2.58 Tg C yr-1. Our analyses also demonstrated that 0.70 Tg C yr-1 are exported to the ocean by Swedish watersheds as HCO(3)- and CO(3)2- of which about 0.56 Tg C yr-1 is also a residual from terrestrial respiration and constitute a long-term sink for atmospheric CO(2). Taking all dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes along the aquatic conduit into account will lower the estimated net ecosystem C exchange (NEE) by 2.02 Tg C yr-1, which corresponds to 10\% of the NEE in Sweden.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Probably because it is a readily available ocean color product, almost all models of primary productivity use chlorophyll as their index of phytoplankton biomass. As other variables become more readily available, both from remote sensing and in situ autonomous platforms, we should ask if other indices of biomass might be preferable. Herein, we compare the accuracy of different proxies of phytoplankton biomass for estimating the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax) and the initial slope of the production versus irradiance (P vs. E) curve ({$\alpha$}). The proxies compared are: the total chlorophyll a concentration (Tchla, the sum of chlorophyll a and divinyl chlorophyll), the phytoplankton absorption coefficient, the phytoplankton photosynthetic absorption coefficient, the active fluorescence in situ, the particulate scattering coefficient at 650 nm (bp(650)), and the particulate backscattering coefficient at 650 nm (bbp(650)). All of the data (about 170 P vs. E curves) were collected in the South Pacific Ocean. We find that when only the phytoplanktonic biomass proxies are available, bp(650) and Tchla are respectively the best estimators of Pmax and {$\alpha$}. When additional variables are available, such as the depth of sampling, the irradiance at depth, or the temperature, Tchla is the best estimator of both Pmax and {$\alpha$}.},

In this study, we examined concentrations and selected spectroscopic properties of DOM and the propensity to form trihalomethanes (THMs) for 19 different middle-sized watersheds across the Han River basin in Korea. Sampling was conducted for non-storm events during pre-monsoon (May) and monsoon seasons (July). The anthropogenic land uses including agricultural and residential areas occupied 2.3 to 49.4 \{\%\} of the upstream catchments of the watersheds. Non-aromatic, labile, and less condensed DOM structures were more abundant in the monsoon season. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling with fluorescence data demonstrated that a combination of three different fluorescence components could explain the seasonal and the spatial distributions of DOM characteristics. Terrestrial humic-like fluorescence was the most abundant component for all the DOM samples, while protein-like fluorescence became more pronounced for the monsoon season. THM concentrations did not differ between the two seasons. Observed seasonal differences in the concentrations and the characteristics of DOM suggested a greater contribution of groundwater to the streams in watersheds in the monsoon versus the pre-monsoon season. Significant correlations among anthropogenic land use, microbial humic-like fluorescence, and the propensity to form THMs were found only for the pre-monsoon season. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that, regardless of the season, anthropogenic land uses increased the concentrations of DOM and nutrients but that their effects on the DOM properties were not evident for the monsoon season.},

The author demonstrates the common features underlying diversity patterns at scales ranging from the polar-equatorial gradients to the margins of temporary ponds, and develops a mechanistic explanation of diversity patterns in different ecosystems. Many of the major concepts in ecology are incorporated into the framework for understanding patterns of diversity on landscapes. Case studies apply the theories and models to savannas, coral reefs, rain forests and other ecosystems. This book presents ideas that will stimulate and challenge professionals and students in ecology, evolutionary biology, resource management, forestry, geography, and environmental economics.},

We review emerging methods to estimate alpha, beta, gamma, and metacommunity diversity through hierarchical multispecies occupancy models (MSOMs) and multispecies abundance models (MSAMs) that explicitly incorporate observation error in the detection process for species or individuals. We examine advantages, limitations, and assumptions of these detection-based hierarchical models for estimating species diversity.

The original objective was to produce community consensus protocols for sample collection, filtration, storage, analysis, and quality assurance for particulate organic carbon in all natural waters, emphasizing marine ecosystems, appropriate for satellite algorithm development and validation. Given the close link between global cycles of carbon and nitrogen and that current analytical protocols usually are geared towards their simultaneous measurement, recommendations for analysis of nitrogen in particles are also included. The hope is that the protocols presented here can be widely adopted by the academic scientific community engaged in aquatic C and N cycle research, particularly in activities that support ocean color validation. The resulting protocol review document: Particulate Organic Matter Sampling and Measurement Protocols: Consensus Towards Future Ocean Color Missions, and the associated workshop activity were sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), including funding for the Field Support Group (NASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program) and a ROSES NNH15ZDA001N-TWSC award to Antonio Mannino, Ivona Cetini\'c, Joaqu\'in Chaves, Michael Novak, and Jeremy Werdell under the NASA Program Topical Workshops, Symposia, and Conferences Program with additional support for contributing authors and workshop participants by their respective institutions.

  abstract = {Arctic sea ice has displayed significant thinning as well as an increase in drift speed in recent years. Taken together this suggests an associated rise in sea ice deformation rate. A winter and spring expedition to the sea ice covered region north of Svalbard\textendash the Norwegian young sea ICE2015 expedition (N-ICE2015)\textemdash gave an opportunity to deploy extensive buoy arrays and tomonitor the deformation of the first-year and second- year ice now common in themajority of the Arctic Basin. During the 5month long expedition, the ice cover underwent several strong deformation events, including a powerful stormin early February that damaged the ice cover irreversibly. The values of total deformation measured during N-ICE2015 exceed previouslymeasured values in the Arctic Basin at similar scales: At 100 kmscale, N-ICE2015 values averaged above 0.1 d21,com- pared to rates of 0.08 d21 or less for previous buoy arrays. The exponent of the power law between the defor- mation length scale and total deformation developed over the season from 0.37 to 0.54 with an abrupt increase immediately after the early February storm, indicating a weakened ice cover withmore free drift of the sea ice floes. Our results point to a general increase in deformation associated with the younger and thin- ner Arctic sea ice and to a potentially destructive role of winter storms.},

The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

Within a geographic region, abiotic effects frequently dictate the relative importance of piscivory, thereby indirectly influencing the composition of prey species present.

Today, the synergistic effects of human impacts are laying the groundwork for a comparably great Anthropocene mass extinction in the oceans with unknown ecological and evolutionary consequences. Synergistic effects of habitat destruction, overfishing, introduced species, warming, acidification, toxins, and massive runoff of nutrients are transforming once complex ecosystems like coral reefs and kelp forests into monotonous level bottoms, transforming clear and productive coastal seas into anoxic dead zones, and transforming complex food webs topped by big animals into simplified, microbially dominated ecosystems with boom and bust cycles of toxic dinoflagellate blooms, jellyfish, and disease. Rates of change are increasingly fast and nonlinear with sudden phase shifts to novel alternative community states. We can only guess at the kinds of organisms that will benefit from this mayhem that is radically altering the selective seascape far beyond the consequences of fishing or warming alone. The prospects are especially bleak for animals and plants compared with metabolically flexible microbes and algae. Halting and ultimately reversing these trends will require rapid and fundamental changes in fisheries, agricultural practice, and the emissions of greenhouse gases on a global scale.},

Although the chemical character of DOM is central to its fate in the global carbon cycle, DOM characterizations in long-term ecological research programs are rarely performed. We analyzed the variability in the quality of 134 DOM samples collected from 12 Long Term Ecological Research stations by quantification of organic carbon and nitrogen concentration in addition to analysis of UV-visible absorbance and fluorescence spectra. The fluorescence spectra were further characterized by parallel factor analysis. There was a large range in both concentration and quality of the DOM, with the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration ranging from less than 1 mgC/L to over 30 mgC/L. The ranges of specific UV absorbance and fluorescence parameters suggested significant variations in DOM composition within a specific study area, on both spatial and temporal scales. There was no correlation between DOC concentration and any DOM quality parameter, illustrating that comparing across biomes, large variations in DOM quality are not necessarily associated with corresponding large ranges in DOC concentrations. The data presented here emphasize that optical properties of DOM can be highly variable and controlled by different physical (e. g., hydrology), chemical (e. g., photoreactivity/redox conditions), and biological (e. g., primary productivity) processes, and as such can have important ecological consequences. This study demonstrates that relatively simple DOM absorbance and/or fluorescence measurements can be incorporated into long-term ecological research and monitoring programs, resulting in advanced understanding of organic matter dynamics in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT, 1, zidovudine, RetrovirTM) is used to treat patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. AZT, after conversion to AZT-5'-triphosphate (AZT-TP) by cellular enzymes, inhibits HIV-reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT). The major clinical limitations of AZT are due to clinical toxicities that include bone marrow suppression, hepatic abnormalities and myopathy, absolute dependence on host cell kinase-mediated activation which leads to low activity, limited brain uptake, a short half-life of about one hour in plasma that dictates frequent administration to maintain therapeutic drug levels, low potential for metabolic activation and/or high susceptibility to catabolism, and the rapid development of resistance by HIV-1. These limitations have prompted the development of strategies for designing prodrugs of AZT. A variety of 5'-O-substituted prodrugs of AZT constitute the subject of this review. The drug-design rationale on which these approaches are based is that the ester conjugate will be converted by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic cleavage to AZT or its 5\&prime;-monophosphate (AZT-MP). Most prodrug derivatives of AZT have been prepared by derivatization of AZT at its 5'-O position to provide two prominent classes of compounds that encompass: A) 5'-O-carboxylic esters derived from 1) cyclic 5'-O-carboxylic acids such as steroidal 17b-carboxylic acids, 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid, bicyclam carboxylic acid derivatives, O-acetylsalicylic acid, and carbohydrate derivatives, 2) amino acids, 3) 1, 4-dihydro-1-methyl-3-pyridinylcarboxylic acid, 4) aliphatic fatty acid analogs such as myristic acid containing a heteroatom, or without a heteroatom such as stearic acid, and 5) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid analogs such as retinoic acid, and B) masked phosphates such as 1) phosphodiesters that include monoalkyl or monoaryl phosphate, carbohydrate, ether lipid, ester lipid, and foscarnet derivatives, 2) a variety of phosphotriesters that include dialkylphosphotriesters, diarylphosphotriesters, glycolate and lactate phosphotriesters, phosphotriester approaches using simultaneous enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis of bis(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters, bis(S-acyl-2-thioethyl) (SATE) esters, cyclosaligenyl prodrugs, glycosyl phosphotriesters, and steroidal phosphotriesters, 3) phosphoramidate derivatives, 4) dinucleoside phosphate derivatives that possess a second anti-HIV moiety such as AZT-P-ddA, AZT-P-ddI, AZTP2AZT, AZTP2ACV), and 5) 5'-hydrogen phosphonate and 5'-methylene phosphonate derivatives of AZT. In these prodrugs, the conjugating moiety is linked to AZT via a 5'-O-ester or 5'-O-phosphate group. 5'-O-Substituted AZT prodrugs have been designed with the objectives of improving anti-HIV activity, enhancing blood-brain barrier penetration, modifying pharmacokinetic properties to increase plasma half-life and improving drug delivery with respect to site-specific targeting or drug localization. Bypassing the first phosphorylation step, regulating transport and conferring sustained release of AZT prolong its duration of action, decrease toxicity and improve patient acceptability. The properties of these prodrugs and their anti-HIV activities are now reviewed.},

We used the database of the Joint Danube Survey JDS-2, organised by the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR, Vienna), to assess the relationship between water flow velocity and the occurrence and abundance of aquatic macrophyte to be species along the navigable reach of the Danube River. Species abundance was assessed in accordance with European Standard EN 14184-2003. Flow velocities were assessed close to the plant stands and estimated in 4 classes, worked out in earlier studies in combination with flow meter measurements, which is appropriate for the conditions in this large river. Statistical analysis revealed that only survey units with either no visible flow or those with fast flow were characterised by indicator species with high significance. Still water conditions or barely visible flow (flow class 1) were indicated by Potamogeton friesii, Nitellopsis obtusa and Trapa natans, and by Potamogeton perfoliatus, Potamogeton nodosus and Stuckenia pectinata. Lemna minor, indicative for flow class 1 as well, was detected in all the other flow classes, too: in all these cases it established its stands closely intermingled with other aquatic species. For survey units with slow (flow class 2) or intermediate flow (flow class 3). No statistically significant indicator species could be determined. The highest flow velocities (flow class 4) were significantly indicated by Fissidens rufulus, Cinclidotus fontinaloides and Cinclidotus riparius. Occurrence of aquatic mosses was also highly related to the Berger-Parker dominance index in NMDS analysis. In the same analysis, but towards the smallest flow velocities, the majority of vascular species and the Simpson diversity index were closely related. The spectrum of life forms was considerably reduced under medium and high flow velocity conditions. With regard to Simpson species diversity, our analysis indicates an agglomeration of diversity in the Middle Danube reach that includes the Iron Gates impoundment. Our results offer a first look at the macrophyte/water flow relationship of a very large river in Europe, the Danube. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {1. Using data from 71, mainly shallow (an average mean depth of 3 m), Danish lakes with contrasting total phosphorus concentrations (summer mean 0.02-1.0 mg P L-1), we describe how species richness, biodiversity and trophic structure change along a total phosphorus (TP) gradient divided into five TP classes (class 1-5: {$<$} 0.05, 0.05-0.1, 0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.4, {$>$} 0.4 mg P L-1). 2. With increasing TP, a significant decline was observed in the species richness of zooplankton and submerged macrophytes, while for fish, phytoplankton and floating-leaved macrophytes, species richness was unimodally related to TP, all peaking at 0.1-0.4 mg P L-1. The Shannon-Wiener and the Hurlbert probability of inter-specific encounter (PIE) diversity indices showed significant unimodal relationships to TP for zooplankton, phytoplankton and fish. Mean depth also contributed positively to the relationship for rotifers, phytoplankton and fish. 3. At low nutrient concentrations, piscivorous fish (particularly perch, Perca fluviatilis) were abundant and the biomass ratio of piscivores to plankti-benthivorous cyprinids was high and the density of cyprinids low. Concurrently, the zooplankton was dominated by large-bodied forms and the biomass ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton and the calculated grazing pressure on phytoplankton were high. Phytoplankton biomass was low and submerged macrophyte abundance high. 4. With increasing TP, a major shift occurred in trophic structure. Catches of cyprinids in multiple mesh size gill nets increased 10-fold from class 1 to class 5 and the weight ratio of piscivores to planktivores decreased from 0.6 in class 1 to 0.10-0.15 in classes 3-5. In addition, the mean body weight of dominant cyprinids (roach, Rutilus rutilus, and bream, Abramis brama) decreased two-threefold. Simultaneously, small cladocerans gradually became more important, and among copepods, a shift occurred from calanoid to cyclopoids. Mean body weight of cladocerans decreased from 5.1 mug in class 1 to 1.5 mug in class 5, and the biomass ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton from 0.46 in class 1 to 0.08-0.15 in classes 3-5. Conversely, phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a increased 15-fold from class 1 to 5 and submerged macrophytes disappeared from most lakes. 5. The suggestion that fish have a significant structuring role in eutrophic lakes is supported by data from three lakes in which major changes in the abundance of planktivorous fish occurred following fish kill or fish manipulation. In these lakes, studied for 8 years, a reduction in planktivores resulted in a major increase in cladoceran mean size and in the biomass ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton, while chlorophyll a declined substantially. In comparison, no significant changes were observed in 33 'control' lakes studied during the same period.},

  abstract = {Photochemical oxidation of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) produces dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC: CO2, HCO3-, CO3-2). The efficiency of this reaction is affected by the source of CDOM and by irradiation history. Here we demonstrate the effect of local, hydrological factors on photochemical efficiency during a phytoplankton bloom in Saanich Inlet, B.C. The rate of photochemical production of DIC decreased during the bloom. We hypothesized that the decrease was caused by: (1) lower reaction efficiency of algally derived CDOM; (2) nitrate-limitation of photochemical oxidation during the bloom; or (3) a change in water mass and source of CDOM. Subsequent laboratory irradiations of a representative algal culture and of CDOM collected from local rivers indicated that the algally derived CDOM was a more efficient photochemical substrate than was the terrigenous material. In addition, while nitrate was drawn down during the bloom, its concentration was not statistically related to the variation in efficiency. Consequently, and in light of hydrographic measurements made during the field experiment, the most likely explanation for the decreased efficiency during the bloom was a change in water mass. During the bloom, the CDOM in surface water was probably dominated by allochthonous material, because the bloom was initiated by the inflow of a nutrient-rich water mass. During this experiment, DIC was produced photochemically at usually {$<$}3\% (0.3-10\%) of the rate of its uptake by total primary production. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Collapse of permafrost coasts delivers large quantities of particulate organic carbon (POC) to Arctic coastal areas. With rapidly changing environmental conditions, sediment and organic carbon (OC) mobilization and transport pathways are also changing. Here, we assess the sources and sinks of POC in the highly dynamic nearshore zone of Herschel Island-Qikiqtaruk (Yukon, Canada). Our results show that POC concentrations sharply decrease, from 15.9 to 0.3 mg L-1, within the first 100\textendash 300 m offshore. Simultaneously, radiocarbon ages of POC drop from 16,400 to 3,600 14C years, indicating rapid settling of old permafrost POC to underlying sediments. This suggests that permafrost OC is, apart from a very narrow resuspension zone (\textexclamdown 5 m water depth), predominantly deposited in nearshore sediments. While long-term storage of permafrost OC in marine sediments potentially limits biodegradation and its subsequent release as greenhouse gas, resuspension of fine-grained, OC-rich sediments in the nearshore zone potentially enhances OC turnover.},

  abstract = {River water is the main source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Arctic Ocean. DOC plays an important role in the Arctic carbon cycle, and its export from land to sea is expected to increase as ongoing climate change accelerates permafrost thaw. However, transport pathways and transformation of DOC in the land-to-ocean transition are mostly unknown. We collected DOC and aCDOM({$\lambda$}) samples from 11 expeditions to river, coastal and offshore waters and present a new DOC-aCDOM({$\lambda$}) model for the fluvial-marine transition zone in the Laptev Sea. The aCDOM({$\lambda$}) characteristics revealed that the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in samples of this dataset are primarily of terrigenous origin. Observed changes in aCDOM(443) and its spectral slopes indicate that DOM is modified by microbial and photo-degradation. Ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) provides the absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter (aCDOM({$\lambda$})sat) at {$\lambda$}=440 or 443 nm, which can be used to estimate DOC concentration at high temporal and spatial resolution over large regions. We tested the statistical performance of five OCRS algorithms and evaluated the plausibility of the spatial distribution of derived aCDOM({$\lambda$})sat. The OLCI (Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) neural network swarm (ONNS) algorithm showed the best performance compared to in situ aCDOM(440) (r2=0.72). Additionally, we found ONNS-derived aCDOM(440), in contrast to other algorithms, to be partly independent of sediment concentration, making ONNS the most suitable aCDOM({$\lambda$})sat algorithm for the Laptev Sea region. The DOC-aCDOM({$\lambda$}) model was applied to ONNS-derived aCDOM(440), and retrieved DOC concentration maps showed moderate agreement to in situ data (r2=0.53). The in situ and satellite-retrieved data were offset by up to several days, which may partly explain the weak correlation for this dynamic region. Satellite-derived surface water DOC concentration maps from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data demonstrate rapid removal of DOC within short time periods in coastal waters of the Laptev Sea, which is likely caused by physical mixing and different types of degradation processes. Using samples from all occurring water types leads to a more robust DOC-aCDOM({$\lambda$}) model for the retrievals of DOC in Arctic shelf and river waters.}

  abstract = {Warming air temperatures, shifting hydrological regimes and accelerating permafrost thaw in the catchments of the Arctic rivers is affecting their biogeochemistry. Arctic river monitoring is necessary to observe changes in the mobilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from permafrost. The Lena River is the second largest Arctic river and 71\% of its catchment is continuous permafrost. Biogeochemical parameters, including temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), stable water isotopes, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and absorption by colored dissolved organic matter (aCDOM) have been measured as part of a new high-frequency sampling program in the central Lena River Delta. The results show strong seasonal variations of all biogeochemical parameters that generally follow seasonal patterns of the hydrograph. Optical indices of DOM indicate a trend of decreasing aromaticity and molecular weight from spring to winter. High-frequency sampling improved our estimated annual fluvial flux of annual dissolved organic carbon flux (6.79 Tg C). EC and stable isotope data were used to distinguish three different source water types which explain most of the seasonal variation in the biogeochemistry of the Lena River. These water types match signatures of (1) melt water, (2) rain water, and (3) subsurface water. Melt water and rain water accounted for 84\% of the discharge flux and 86\% of the DOC flux. The optical properties of melt water DOM were characteristic of fresh organic matter. In contrast, the optical properties of DOM in subsurface water revealed lower aromaticity and lower molecular weights, which indicate a shift toward an older organic matter source mobilized from deeper soil horizons or permafrost deposits. The first year of this new sampling program sets a new baseline for flux calculations of dissolved matter and has enabled the identification and characterization of water types that drive the seasonality of the Lena River water properties.},

Focus of the sampling was put on surface waters to compare with satellite imagery and capture the signal of the Mackenzie River water throughout the coastal waters of the Beaufort Sea. The water samples for the biogeochemical data were taken using pumps or niskin bottles. The repeated sampling focused on the two main outflow regions of the Mackenzie River: Shallow Bay and Mackenzie Bay in the west and Kugmallit Bay in the east as well as on the river channels across the delta. Most sampling locations were revisited four times. Sampling during different seasons was extremely challenging in this region due to uncertain ice cover and broken ice fields during and after ice break-up. Additionally, very shallow water (\textexclamdown 5 m) mandates the use of small draught boats, which was challenging under frequently harsh weather conditions. To tackle these challenges, various sampling platforms were used such as small boats, trucks, ski-doos and hovering helicopter. The campaigns were carried out under the umbrella of the EU Horizon 2020 project Nunataryuk.}

Our model captures the main elements of both theories by incorporating the combined effects of area, isolation, stochastic colonization and extinction processes, habitat heterogeneity, and niche partitioning in a unified, demographically based framework. While classical niche theory predicts a positive relationship between species richness and habitat heterogeneity, our unified model demonstrates that area limitation and dispersal limitation (the main elements of island biogeography) may create unimodal and even negative relationships between species richness and habitat heterogeneity. We attribute this finding to the fact that increasing heterogeneity increases the potential number of species that may exist in a given area (as predicted by niche theory) but simultaneously reduces the amount of suitable area available for each species and, thus, increases the likelihood of stochastic extinction. Area limitation, dispersal limitation, and low reproduction rates intensify the latter effect by increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinction. These analytical results demonstrate that the integration of island biogeography and niche theory provides new insights about the mechanisms that regulate the diversity of ecological communities and generates unexpected predictions that could not be attained from any single theory.},

These effects need to be known if dissolved hurnic substances are to be a major factor in identifying the impact of present and future changes in land use. Dissolved fulvic acids (topsoil, ground- water) from highly degraded peatlands (due to a long-term agricultural use) exhibit lower C/N ratios, higher absorption in the UV spectra, and higher absorption at 1,620 cm -1 in the FTIR spectra compared with fulvic acids from relatively intact peatlands. These properties illustrate that long-term agricultural use with high inputs results in increased aromatic s{\~ }uctures and a further humification of dissolved fulvic acids due to very strong peat decomposition compared with relatively intact peatlands. Synchronous fluorescence spectra also indicate the higher level of aromatic structures within fulvic acids isolated from sites with long-term agricultural use (high peat decomposition) compared with a land use history resulting in a lower peat decomposition. The different sources of fulvic acids in surface water (precipitation, runoff, interflow, groundwater) are the main reason for these effects not being detected in fulvic acids isolated from surface water. Short-term changes in land use characterized by a transition from crop farming to an unimproved grassland were found not to affect the spectroscopic properties of dissolved fulvic acids. A humification index deduced from the synchronous fluorescence spectra is proposed. We have strong evidence that dissolved humic substances indicate changes in the environmental conditions (both anthropogenic and natural) of wetlands with a high proportion of organic soils.},

A 4-month mass-balance study during the summer quantified the net effect of a large ({$\sim$}5.5 ha) undisturbed macrophyte bed on these water-column properties. The bed is located in a slow-flowing (0.05\textendash 0.1 cm s-1) channel between two lakes, allowing for the quantification of inputs and outputs. The P budget for the study period showed that, despite considerable short-term variation, the macrophyte bed was a negligible net sink for P (0.06 mg m-2 day-1, range from -0.76 to +0.79 mg m-2 day-1), demonstrating that loading and uptake processes in the weedbed roughly balance over the summer. Chlorophyll a was disproportionately retained relative to particulate organic carbon (POC), indicating that the algal component of the POC was preferentially trapped. However, the principal contribution of the weedbed to the open water was a consistent positive influence on bacterioplankton production over the summer. Conservative extrapolations based on measured August specific exports (m-2 day-1) of P and bacterial production exiting the weedbed applied to five regional lakes varying in lake morphometry and macrophyte cover suggest that even in the most macrophyte dominated of lakes (66\% cover), P loading from submerged weedbeds never exceeds 1\% day-1 of standing epilimnetic P levels, whereas subsidization of bacterioplankton production can reach upward of 20\% day-1. The presence of submerged macrophytes therefore differentially modifies algae and bacteria in the water column, while modestly altering P dynamics over the summer.},

From the longitudinal C-13 uptake curve, we resolved labile and semi-labile DOC classes within the C-13-DOC tracer comprising 82\% and 18\% of the tracer respectively. 4. Plug-flow laboratory bioreactors colonized and maintained with stream water were used to determine the concentration of stream water DOC fractions that had a similar lability to the labile and semi-labile classes within the tracer and we assumed that stream water DOC and tracer DOC with comparable lability fractions in the bioreactors behaved similarly in the stream, i.e. they had the same mass transfer coefficients. 5.

These uptake lengths suggest that the labile DOC is an energy source within a stream reach, while the semi-labile DOC is exported out of the reach to larger rivers and the downstream estuary, where it may provide energy for marine microbial communities or simply be exported to the oceans.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter describes the dynamics of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for all living organisms; life is truly built around P. In the sea, P exists in both dissolved and particulate pools with inorganic and organic forms. The uptake, re-mineralization, and physical and biological exchanges among these various pools are the essential components of the marine P cycle. Compared to the much more comprehensive investigations of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in the sea, P pool inventories and fluxes are less well documented though no less important. During cell growth, P is incorporated into a broad spectrum of organic compounds with vital functions including structure, metabolism, and regulation. When cells turn over (by death/autolysins, grazing, parasitism, or viral infection), there is an enhanced release of intracellular P-containing compounds as both dissolved and particulate organic matter.},

  abstract = {A mass-balance model was developed to simulate organic matter (OM) dynamics in headwater stream ecosystems of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Empirical data from two streams were used to structure and test a mass-balance model of the riparian-stream system. The model was driven by data on inputs, outputs, processing rates, discharge and water temperature. Statistical sub-models were derived for different processes (e.g. decomposition rates and periphyton growth). Inputs and outputs of OM were modelled on the basis of a series of assumptions of system properties, such as temperature and hydrological regimes. Major uncertainties identified through Monte-Carlo simulations of model predictions and variables important in controlling OM dynamics in these streams were dissolved OM (DOM) import and export, stream area and litterfall import. DOM was quantitatively the most important source of OM, accounting for 80\% of total export of OM, followed by export of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) at 15\%. Different scenarios of logging and temperature regimes on the system were simulated to predict how these factors would affect standing stock of OM in the stream. When inputs of riparian litterfall were simulated to mirror reductions predicted from forest harvesting in the riparian area particulate OM (POM) standing stock was reduced by almost 80\%. In comparison, a 3 degrees C increase in water temperature resulted in only a 20\% reduction of POM standing stock due to enhanced mineralisation. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Limitation of productivity by nutrient availability is an established paradigm for lake ecosystems. Here, we assess the relevance of this paradigm for a majority of the world's small, nutrient-poor lakes, with different concentrations of coloured organic matter. By comparing small unproductive lakes along a water colour gradient, we show that coloured terrestrial organic matter controls the key process for new biomass synthesis (the benthic primary production) through its effects on light attenuation. We also show that this translates into effects on production and biomass of higher trophic levels (benthic invertebrates and fish). These results are inconsistent with the idea that nutrient supply primarily controls lake productivity, and we propose that a large share of the world's unproductive lakes, within natural variations of organic carbon and nutrient input, are limited by light and not by nutrients. We anticipate that our result will have implications for understanding lake ecosystem function and responses to environmental change. Catchment export of coloured organic matter is sensitive to short-term natural variability and long-term, large-scale changes, driven by climate and different anthropogenic influences. Consequently, changes in terrestrial carbon cycling will have pronounced effects on most lake ecosystems by mediating changes in light climate and productivity of lakes.},

The impact of anisotropy on the light field under sea ice was found to be substantial and has been quantified. In this study, a large data set of irradiance and radiance measurements under sea ice has been acquired with a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) in the central Arctic. Measurements are interpreted in the context of numerical radiative transfer calculations, laboratory experiments, and microstructure analysis. The ratio of synchronous measurements of transmitted irradiance to radiance shows a clear deviation from an isotropic under-ice light field. We find that the angular radiance distribution under sea ice is more downward directed than expected for an isotropic light field. This effect can be attributed to the anisotropic scattering coefficient within sea ice. Assuming an isotropic radiance distribution under sea ice leads to significant errors in light-field modeling and the interpretation of radiation measurements. Quantification of the light field geometry is crucial for correct conversion of radiance data acquired by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and ROVs.},

Currently radiative transfer problems are usually considered in horizontally homogeneous layers although it is known to be a crude assumption in many cases. In this paper, we examine the effects of a horizontally inhomogeneous sea ice layer on the light field in the water underneath. We implemented a three dimensional model, capable to simulate the light field underneath arbitrary surface geometries using ray optics. The results show clear effects of the measurement geometry on measured fluxes obtained with different sensor types, which need to be taken into account for the correct interpretation of the data. Radiance sensors are able to better sense the spatial variability of ice optical properties as compared to irradiance sensors. Furthermore, we show that the determination of the light extinction coefficient of water from vertical profiles is complicated under a horizontally inhomogeneous ice cover. This uncertainty in optical properties of the water, as well as the measurement geometry also limits the possibility to correct light measurements taken at depth for the influence of water in between the sea ice and the sensor.},

The vehicle is designed for efficient operations in the harsh polar conditions. Redundant modular design allows operation by three scientists simultaneously operating a wide variety of sensors. Sensors from physical, chemical and biological oceanography are combined with optical and acoustic sea ice sensors to provide a comprehensive picture of the underside of sea ice. The sensor suite provides comprehensive capabilities and can be further extended as additional ports for power and communication are available. The vehicle provides full six degrees of freedom in navigation, enabling intervention and manipulation skills despite its simple one function manipulator arm.},

Intrinsic viscosities under given solute/solvent/temperature conditions were obtained by extrapolating the concentration dependence of reduced viscosities to zero concentration. Molecular mass (weight average molecular weight (M (w)) and number average molecular weight (M (n))) and hydrodynamic radius (R(H)) were determined by HPSEC using pullulan as calibrant. Values of M (w) and M (n) ranged from 15 to 118 x 10(3) and from 9 to 50 x 10(3) (g mol(-1)), respectively. Polydispersity, as indicated by M (w)/M (n), increased with increasing filter size from 1.5 to 2.4. The hydrodynamic radii (R(H)) ranged between 2.2 and 6.4 nm. For each humic acid, M (w) and [eta] were related. Mark-Houwink coefficients calculated on the basis of the M (w)-[eta] relationships suggested restricted flexible chains for two of the humic acids and a branched structure for the third humic acid. Those structures probably behave as hydrated sphere colloids in a good solvent. Hydrodynamic radii of fractions calculated from [eta] using Einstein's equation, which is applicable to hydrated sphere colloids, ranged from 2.2 to 7.1 nm. These dimensions are fit to the size of nanospaces on and between clay minerals and micropores in soil particle aggregates. On the other hand, the good agreement of R(H) values obtained by applying Einstein's equation with those directly determined by HPSEC suggests that pullulan is a suitable calibrant for estimation of molecular mass and size of humic acids by HPSEC.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem responses to external changes can surprise us by their abruptness and irreversibility. Models have helped identifying indicators of impending catastrophic shifts, referred to as `generic early warning signals'. These indicators are linked to a phenomenon known as `critical slowing down' which describes the fact that the recovery rate of a system after a perturbation decreases when the system approaches a bifurcation \textendash{} such as the classical fold bifurcation associated to catastrophic shifts. However, contrary to what has sometimes been suggested in the literature, a decrease in recovery rate cannot be considered as specific to approaching catastrophic shifts. Here, we analyze the behavior of early warning signals based on critical slowing down in systems approaching a range of catastrophic and non-catastrophic situations. Our results show that slowing down generally happens in situations where a system is becoming increasingly sensitive to external perturbations, independently of whether the impeding change is catastrophic or not. These results highlight that indicators specific to catastrophic shifts are still lacking. More importantly, they also imply that in systems where we have no reason to expect catastrophic transitions, slowing down may still be used in a more general sense as a warning signal for a potential decrease in stability.},

However, the empirical validation of these indicators lag behind their theoretical developments. Here, we summarize a range of currently available spatial early warning signals, suggest potential null models to interpret their trends, and apply them to three simulated spatial data sets of systems undergoing an abrupt transition. In addition to providing a step-by-step methodology for applying these signals to spatial data sets, we propose a statistical toolbox that may be used to help detect approaching transitions in a wide range of spatial data.

Important features of the model are: (1) carbon and nitrogen are incorporated by means of a set of fixed and varying C:N ratios; (2) dissolved organic matter (DOM) is separated into labile, semi-labile, and refractory pools for both C and N; (3) the production and consumption of DOM is treated in detail; and (4) seasonal observations of light, temperature, nutrients, and surface layer circulation are used to physically force the model. The model reasonably reproduces the mean observed seasonal concentrations of nutrients, DOM, plankton biomass, and chlorophyll a. The results suggest that estuarine DOM production is intricately tied to the biomass concentration, ratio, and productivity of phytoplankton, zooplankton, viruses, and bacteria. During peak spring productivity phytoplankton exudation and zooplankton sloppy feeding are the most important autochthonous sources of DOM. In the summer when productivity peaks again, autochthonous sources of DOM are more diverse and, in addition to phytoplankton exudation, important ones include viral lysis and the decay of detritus. The potential importance of viral decay as a source of bioavailable DOM from within the bulk DOM pool is also discussed. The results also highlight the importance of some poorly constrained processes and parameters. Some potential improvements and remedies are suggested.

High ice production in the major coastal polynyas is well demon- strated. The total annual cumulative ice production in the major 10 polynya regions is about 1180{$\pm$}70km3. The interannual variability of the ice production for each polynya is presented during 2002\textendash 2011. No obvious relationship is noted between the ice production and the recent drastic reduction in the preceding summer Arctic sea ice extent. Most polynya regions exhibit maximum ice production in autumn (October \textendash{} November), before areas offshore have been covered with consolidated pack ice. Sea ice production from October to November in the marginal ice zone of the Pacific Ocean sector is negatively correlated with summer ice extent there. The ice production from October to November of 2007 (a record minimum summer ice extent) was about twice as large as that in other years. The high ice production area shifted to higher latitudes i.e., toward the deep Canada Basin, due to the retreat of the summer ice edge. We speculate that the resultant increase in brine input could change the oceanic structure in the basin, specifically deep- ening the winter mixed layer.},

The computational domain includes the cross sections from the Miryang river junction to the downstream barrage end of the Nakdong River. The length of the reach is 45 km. Mulgeum intake station is located west side of applied domain. During the operating of the water gate, the velocity magnitude and concentration are analyzed around intake.

The physiological basis of the leucine method is protein synthesis. Biomass production can be calculated from rates of protein synthesis because protein comprises a large, fairly constant fraction of bacterial biomass. It is possible to calculate biomass production without information about the cell sizes of bacterial assemblages. Leucine incorporation into protein is measured by following the appearance of radioactivity into material that is insoluble in hot trichloroacetic acid. Leu can be synthesized from other compounds, which leads to isotope dilution of the added radiolabeled Leu. The other potential problem with the Leu method is protein turnover. D. L. Kirchman et al. argued that it may be useful to measure protein turnover if organic matter is mineralized during protein turnover.},

Local conditions (e. g., resource and predator densities) can have independent effects, as well as interact with dispersal, to alter these patterns. Based on metacommunity models, we predicted that local diversity would show a unimodal relationship with dispersal frequency. We manipulated dispersal frequencies, resource levels, and the presence of predators (mosquito larvae) among communities found in the water-filled leaves of the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. Diversity and abundance of species of the middle trophic level, protozoa and rotifers, were measured. Increased dispersal frequencies significantly increased regional species richness and protozoan abundance while decreasing the variance among local communities. Dispersal frequency interacted with predation at the local community scale to produce patterns of diversity consistent with the model. When predators were absent, we found a unimodal relationship between dispersal frequency and diversity, and when predators were present, there was a flat relationship. Intermediate dispersal frequencies maintained some species in the inquiline communities by offsetting extinction rates. Local community composition and the degree of connectivity between communities are both important for understanding species diversity patterns at local and regional scales.},

Despite the potential for species coexistence occurring at local or regional spatial scales, trade-offs are typically approached at a single scale. In recent years, ecologists have increasingly provided evidence for the importance of community processes at both local and regional spatial scales. This review summarizes the theoretical predictions for the traits associated with trade-offs under different conditions and at different spatial scales. We provide a spatial framework for understanding trade-offs, coexistence and the supportive empirical evidence. Predictions are presented that link the patterns of diversity observed to the patterns of trade-offs that lead to coexistence at different spatial scales. Recent evidence for the evolution of trade-offs under different conditions is provided which explores both laboratory microcosm studies and phylogenetic tests. Examining trade-offs within a spatial framework can provide a strong approach to understanding community structure and dynamics, while explaining patterns of species diversity.},

As a means of assessing the relative importance of autotrophy and heterotrophy in large rivers, we compared phytoplankton production, heterotrophic bacterial production and community respiration in three regulated rivers of the Midwestern USA. Samples were collected monthly (March to December 1999) from impoundments of the Ohio (McAlpine Pool), Cumberland (Lake Barkley), and Tennessee (Kentucky Lake) Rivers. Bacterial production was tightly coupled to phytoplankton production at each site (r(2) = 0.63-0.85). Ratios of phytoplankton production to bacterial production ranged from {$<$} 1 to 15 in the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers and 2 to 90 in the Ohio River. The ratio of primary production to community respiration (P:R) ranged from 0.03 to 2.76 across all sites, with average P:R values lower in the Ohio River (0.14) than the Tennessee River (0.39) and the Cumberland River (1.10). P:R values above unity (P {$>$} R) were observed only in the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers during seasonal (April-July) spikes in primary production. We estimate that 3, 6, and 20\% of annual bacterial carbon requirements were met by exudates from in situ phytoplankton in the Ohio River, Tennessee River, and Cumberland River, respectively. Our findings indicate that heterotrophic bacteria were largely dependant upon allochthonous carbon. Autochthonous sources provided supplemental organic matter (up to 40\% of bacterial carbon demand) during summer low flow.},

  abstract = {The fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is suppressed by a phenomenon of self-quenching known as the inner filter effect (IFE). Despite widespread use of fluorescence to characterize DOM in surface waters, the advantages and constraints of IFE correction are poorly defined. We assessed the effectiveness of a commonly used absorbance-based approach (ABA), and a recently proposed controlled dilution approach (CDA) to correct for IFE. Linearity between corrected fluorescence and total absorbance (ATotal; the sum of absorbance at excitation and emission wavelengths) across the full excitation-emission matrix (EEM) in dilution series of four samples indicated both ABA and CDA were effective to an absorbance of at least 1.5 in a 1 cm cell, regardless of wavelength positioning. In regions of the EEMs where signal to background noise (S/N) was low, CDA correction resulted in more variability than ABA correction. From the ABA algorithm, the onset of significant IFE ({$>$}5\%) occurs when absorbance exceeds 0.042. In these cases, IFE correction is required, which was the case for the vast majority (97\%) of lakes in a nationwide survey (n= 554). For highly absorbing samples, undesirably large dilution factors would be necessary to reduce absorbance below 0.042. For rare EEMs with ATotal {$>$} 1.5 (3.0\% of the lakes in the Swedish survey), a 2-fold dilution is recommended followed by ABA or CDA correction. This study shows that for the vast majority of natural DOM samples the most commonly applied ABA algorithm provides adequate correction without prior dilution. \textcopyright{} 2013, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

We have applied a conservative mixing model of CDOMs optical properties to a dataset collected in the Baltic Sea during 11 years of continuous observations in 1993-2004. The majority of observations agreed well with the model indicating that conservative mixing is important in the area, as terrestrial organic matter is diluted with open sea water. Deviations from the conservative mixing pattern mainly occurred at salinities over 6.8, and chlorophyll a concentrations 3 over 1.5 mg m(-3), and were located in open sea waters, coastal zone and Pomeranian Bay. The seasonal dependence between the light absorption coefficient by CDOM a(CDOM)(375) and salinity and chlorophyll a concentrations was explored. In March, April and November, months of intensive mixing and high riverine discharge, most of the variability in a(CDOM)(375) values could be explained by dilution of terrestrially derived CDOM alone. In February, May, and September, months of thermal stratification, reduced riverine discharge and enhanced biological activity, inclusion of chlorophyll a concentration resulted in significantly better models. Autochthonous production of CDOM was found to be a significant source of CDOM in the Southern Baltic Sea in these months. A series of algorithms for the prediction of CDOMs optical properties is presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In this study, the CDOM absorption coefficient at 350nm [aCDOM(350)] and CDOM excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence were used to estimate annual fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the Cape Fear River to Long Bay in the South Atlantic Bight. Water samples were collected during a 3.5year period, from October 2001 through March 2005, in the vicinity of the Cape Fear River (CFR) outlet and adjacent Onslow Bay (OB). Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of CDOM EEM spectra identified six components: three terrestrial humic-like, one marine humic-like and two protein-like. Empirical relationships were derived from the PARAFAC model between DOC concentration and aCDOM(350), total fluorescence intensity and the intensities of respective EEM components. DOC concentration and CDOM optical parameters were very well correlated and R2 values ranged from 0.77 to 0.90. Regression analyses revealed that the non-absorbing DOC fraction, in DOC concentration estimated from CDOM optical parameters, varied with the qualitative composition of the CDOM. DOC concentration and intensity of the humic-like CDOM components characterized by excitation maxima at longer wavelengths have significantly higher estimated non-absorbing DOC compared to the analogous relationships between DOC and intensity of the humic-like CDOM components characterized by excitation maxima at shorter wavelengths. The relationships between DOC concentration and intensity of one of the protein-like components resulted in significantly reduced non-absorbing DOC fraction in DOC concentration estimation. Results of regression analyses between fluorescence intensities of specific EEM components and CDOM-specific absorption coefficients suggest that the relative proportion of humic-like CDOM components (characterized by excitation maximum at longer wavelengths) and the main protein-like component have the most impact on the values of a⁎CDOM(350). Based on the relationships between aCDOM(350), Cape Fear River flow, and DOC concentrations, DOC fluxes were estimated for 2002, 2003 and 2004. DOC fluxes varied from 1.5 to 6.2\texttimes 1010gCyr-1, depending on river flow.},

  abstract = {Absorption spectra and induced fluorescence excitation emission matrices of colored dissolved organic matter were measured in water samples collected along the Atlantic Meridional Transect in different bio-geographic provinces of the Atlantic Ocean from October to November 2010. The highest values of CDOM absorption coefficient at 305nm (aCDOM(305)), were recorded at the continental margins of the English Channel and Patagonian Shelf. The lowest values of aCDOM(305) were observed in the mixed layer of both North and South Atlantic subtropical oligotrophic gyres. The DOM composition was assessed using fluorescence spectroscopy, Excitation Emission Matrix spectra (EEMs) and the Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) model in addition to spectral indices calculated from CDOM absorption spectrum and EEMs. Six different components were identified in the EEMs by PARAFAC: Two components were similar to the humic-like fraction of DOM, associated with basin scale microbial mineralization processes. These components represent allochthonous DOM in the biogeographic provinces studied. One component of marine humic-like material of autochthonous origin was associated with DOM production from marine phytoplankton. Three components were associated with protein-like DOM. Two protein-like components had the spectral characteristics of pure tryptophan and tyrosine. There was a significant difference in DOM composition both between bio-geographical provinces and above and below the mixed layer. In the mixed layer in all provinces, except the waters of the Western European Shelf, the DOM was dominated by protein-like components. At the Western European Shelf, it was dominated by humic-like components. Fluorescence intensities of humic-like components were high at the Patagonian Shelf, but were up to 40\% lower compared to northern hemisphere shelf waters. Humic-like components made a significant contribution to the DOM composition of the upper mesopelagic layer in all provinces, with the highest values at the Equatorial Upwelling Zone. There was a significant inverse relationship between humic-like components and salinity and temperature and a positive relationship with Apparent Oxygen Utilization. The humification index (HIX) was linearly correlated with the intensity of the humic-like DOM components. These trends suggest that the humic-like components are in dynamic equilibrium between likely microbial production in the deep ocean and photochemical degradation in the mixed layer. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We quantified and compared benthic and pelagic GPP along nutrient gradients in time and space in the shallow estuary, Limfjorden, Denmark, based on monitoring data combined with historical information. Limf- jorden experienced a shift from a pristine, benthic-dominated clear water regime with high total GPP in the early twentieth century to a eutrophic, plankton-dominated regime still with high total GPP in the 1980s when nutrient loadings peaked. Recent reductions in nutrient loadings reduced pelagic GPP, particularly in spring, but water clarity and benthic GPP did not increase correspondingly, so totalGPP declined. Themost nutrient-rich basins have remained plankton-dominated, with benthic vegetation constrained to shallow waters. The results support existing evidence that total GPP of shallow coastal areas does not increase systematically with eutrophication. Furthermore, the results suggest that total GPP may decline temporarily during oligotrophication as pelagic GPP declines, while feedback mechanisms delay or prevent restoration to a state with benthic dominance of GPP.},

To date, our quantitative understanding of diversity gradients of megadiverse clades such as plants has been hampered by the paucity of distribution data. Here, we investigate the global-scale species-richness pattern of vascular plants and examine its environmental and potential historical determinants. Across 1,032 geographic regions worldwide, potential evapotranspiration, the number of wet days per year, and measurements of topographical and habitat heterogeneity emerge as core predictors of species richness. After accounting for environmental effects, the residual differences across the major floristic kingdoms are minor, with the exception of the uniquely diverse Cape Region, highlighting the important role of historical contingencies. Notably, the South African Cape region contains more than twice as many species as expected by the global environmental model, confirming its uniquely evolved flora. A combined multipredictor model explains approximately 70\% of the global variation in species richness and fully accounts for the enigmatic latitudinal gradient in species richness. The models illustrate the geographic interplay of different environmental predictors of species richness. Our findings highlight that different hypotheses about the causes of diversity gradients are not mutually exclusive, but likely act synergistically with water-energy dynamics playing a dominant role. The presented geostatistical approach is likely to prove instrumental for identifying richness patterns of the many other taxa without single-species distribution data that still escape our understanding.},

  abstract = {Coastal recreation and water quality are major contributors to human well-being in coastal regions. They can also interact, creating opportunities for ecosystem based management, ecological restoration, and water quality improvement that can positively affect people and the environment. Yet the effect of environmental quality on human behavior is often poorly quantified, but commonly assumed in coastal ecosystem service studies. To clarify this effect we investigate a water quality dataset for evidence that environmental condition partially explains variation in recreational visitation, our indicator of human behavior. In Puget Sound, WA, we investigate variation in visitation in both visitation rate and fixed effects (FE) models. The visitation rate model relates the differences in annual recreational visitation among parks to environmental conditions, park characteristics, travel cost, and recreational demand. In our FE model we control for all time-invariant unobserved variables and compare monthly variation at the park level to determine how water quality affects visitation during the summer season. The results of our first model illustrate how visitation relates to various amenities and costs. In the FE analysis, monthly visitation was negatively related to water quality while controlling for monthly visitation trends. This indicates people are responding to changes in water quality, and an improvement would yield an increase in the value of recreation. Together, these results could help in prioritizing water quality improvements, could assist the creation of new parks or the modification of existing recreational infrastructure, and provide quantitative estimates for the expected benefits from potential changes in recreational visitation and water quality improvements. Our results also provide an example of how recreational visitation can be quantified and used in ecosystem service assessments.},

The sources of pollutants can, however, be difficult to identify due to high heterogeneity in groundwater flow patterns. This study presents a novel approach for fast hydrological surveys of small groundwater-fed lakes using multiple groundwater-borne tracers. Water samples were collected from the lake and temporary groundwater wells, installed every 50 m within a distance of 5\textendash 45 m to the shore, were analysed for tracer concentrations of CDOM, DOC, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN, groundwater only), total nitrogen (TN, lake only), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP, groundwater only), total phosphorus (TP, lake only), {$\delta$}18O / {$\delta$}16O isotope ratios and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) components derived from parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The isolation of groundwater recharge areas was based on {$\delta$}18O measurements and areas with a high groundwater recharge rate were identified using a microbially influenced FDOM component. Groundwater discharge sites and the fractions of water delivered from the individual sites were isolated with the Community Assembly via Trait Selection model (CATS). The CATS model utilized tracer measurements of TDP, TDN, DOC and CDOM from the groundwater samples and related these to the tracer measurements of TN, TP, DOC and CDOM in the lake. A direct comparison between the lake and the inflowing groundwater was possible as degradation rates of the tracers in the lake were taken into account and related to a range of water retention times (WRTs) of the lake (0.25\textendash 3.5 years in 0.25-year increments). These estimations showed that WRTs above 2 years required a higher tracer concentration of inflowing water than found in any of the groundwater wells around the lake. From the estimations of inflowing tracer concentration, the CATS model isolated groundwater discharge sites located mainly in the eastern part of the lake with a single site in the southern part. Observations from the eastern part of the lake revealed an impermeable clay layer that promotes discharge during heavy precipitation events, which would otherwise be difficult to identify using traditional hydrological methods. In comparison to the lake concentrations, high tracer concentrations in the southern part showed that only a smaller fraction of water could originate from this area, thereby confirming the model results. A Euclidean cluster analysis of {$\delta$}18O isotopes identified recharge sites corresponding to areas adjacent to drainage channels, and a cluster analysis of the microbially influenced FDOM component C4 further identified five sites that showed a tendency towards high groundwater recharge rate. In conclusion, it was found that this methodology can be applied to smaller lakes within a short time frame, providing useful information regarding the WRT of the lake and more importantly the groundwater recharge and discharge sites around the lake. Thus, it is a tool for specific management of the catchment.},

DOC is a heterogeneous mixture of molecules, some of which are imported from the watershed (allochthonous DOC) and others that are produced by autotrophs within the system (autochthonous DOC). We examined the importance of autochthonous versus allochthonous DOC in supporting the growth of pelagic bacteria by manipulating the C-13 content of autochthonous sources in a whole-lake experiment. (NaHCO3)-C-13 was added daily to two small forested lakes for a period of 42 d, thereby strongly labeling autochthonous primary production. To obtain bacterial carbon isotopes, bacteria were regrown in vitro in particle-free lake water and in situ in dialysis tubes; little difference was found between the two methods. The contribution of autochthonous versus allochthonous carbon to the bacterial biomass was estimated by applying a two-member mixing model using a C-13 of -28parts per thousand as the allochthonous end member. The autochthonous end member, which varied over time, was estimated indirectly by several approaches. The bacterial biomass consisted of 35-70\% allochthonous carbon. This result confirms the often-stated hypothesis that autochthonous carbon alone does not support bacterial production. On the other hand, autochthonous DOC was preferentially utilized relative to terrestrial DOC. On the basis of C-13 measurements, only 13\% of the DOC standing stock was of recent autochthonous origin, but it supported 30-65\% of bacterial production.},

In pelagic systems, bacterial growth and biomass is well correlated with the growth and biomass of primary producers. However, bacterial respiration often exceeds net primary production, which suggests that bacteria are subsidized by external inputs of organic matter. We hypothesize that bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) varies systematically between autochthonous and allochthonous carbon (C) sources and that this variation resolves the above conundrum. To test these ideas, we examined the ecological regulation of bacterial secondary production (BP), bacterial respiration (BR) and BGE in a series of lakes dominated by terrestrial (allochthonous) C inputs. BP was correlated with autochthonous C sources (chlorophyll a) even though the lakes were net heterotrophic (i.e. heterotrophic respiration consistently exceeded primary production). The results were simulated by a simple steady-state model of bacterial utilization of autochthonous and allochthonous dissolved organic C. A higher preference and greater growth efficiency of bacteria on autochthonous C may explain why BP is coupled to autochthonous production also in net heterotrophic ecosystems where the use of allochthonous C by bacteria is high. These results suggest that little of the allochthonous C assimilated by bacteria is likely to reach higher consumers.},

We also performed batch culture experiments with amendments of various organic substrates, namely fulvic acids, leachates from algae, and birch and maple leaves. Differences in bacterial community composition between the lakes, analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, correlated with variables related to the relative loading of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon (water colour, dissolved organic carbon, nutrients, and pH). Seasonal changes correlated with temperature, chlorophyll and dissolved organic carbon in both lakes. The substrate amendments led to differences in both structure and function, i.e. production, respiration and growth yield, of the bacterial community.

By manipulating the C-13 of dissolved inorganic C, thereby labeling within-lake primary production, we examined the relative importance of autochthonous and allochthonous C in supporting bacterial production. For 35 days, (NaHCO3)-C-13 was added daily to two small, forested lakes. One of the lakes (Peter) was fertilized so that primary production exceeded total respiration in the epilimnion. The other lake (Tuesday), in contrast, was low in productivity and had high levels of colored dissolved organic C (DOC). To obtain bacterial C isotopes, bacteria were regrown in situ in particle-free lake water in dialysis tubes. The contribution of allochthonous C to bacterial biomass was calculated by applying a two-member mixing model. In the absence of a direct measurement, the isotopic signature of the autochthonous end-member was estimated indirectly by three different approaches. Although there was excess primary production in Peter Lake, bacterial biomass consisted of 43-46\% allochthonous C. In Tuesday Lake more than 75\% of bacterial growth was supported by allochthonous C. Although bacteria used autochthonous C preferentially over allochthonous C, DOC from the watershed contributed significantly to bacterial production. In combination with results from similar experiments in different lakes, our findings suggest that the contribution of allochthonous C to bacterial production can be predicted from ratios of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a surrogate for allochthonous supply) and chlorophyll a (a surrogate for autochthonous supply).},

Here we investigate the utility of new technology in airborne laser surveying (NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL)) in assessing topographical complexity (rugosity) to predict reef fish community structure on shallow ({$<$} 10 m deep) patch reefs. Marine portions of Biscayne National Park, Florida, USA, were surveyed remotely using the EAARL, and reef fish populations were visually surveyed on 10 patch reefs at independent, randomly selected stations (n = 10-13 per reef). Rugosity at each station was assessed in situ by divers using the traditional chain-transect method (10-m scale), and remotely using the EAARL submarine topography data at multiple spatial scales (2, 5, and 10 m). The rugosity and biological datasets were analyzed together to elucidate the predictive power of EAARL rugosity in describing the variance in reef fish community variables and to assess the correlation between chain-transect and EAARL rugosity. EAARL rugosity was not well correlated with chain-transect rugosity, or with species richness of fishes (although statistically significant, the amount of variance explained by the model was very low). Variance in reef fish community attributes was better explained in reef-by-reef variability than by physical variables. However, once the reef-by-reef variability was taken into account in a two-way analysis of variance, the importance of rugosity could be seen on individual reefs. Fish species richness and abundance were statistically higher at high rugosity stations compared to medium and low rugosity stations, as predicted by prior ecological research. The EAARL shows promise as an important mapping tool for reef resource managers as they strive to inventory and protect coral reef resources.},

  abstract = {We examine the basinwide trends in sea ice circulation and drift speed and highlight the changes between 1982 and 2009 in connection to regional winds, multiyear sea ice coverage, ice export, and the thinning of the ice cover. The polarity of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) is used as a backdrop for summarizing the variance and shifts in decadal drift patterns. The 28-year circulation fields show a net strengthening of the Beaufort Gyre and the Transpolar Drift, especially during the last decade. The imprint of the arctic dipole anomaly on the mean summer circulation is evident (2001\textendash 2009) and enhances summer ice area export at the Fram Strait. Between 2001 and 2009, the large spatially averaged trends in drift speeds (winter: +23.6\%/decade, summer: +17.7\%/decade) are not explained by the much smaller trends in wind speeds (winter: 1.46\%/decade, summer: -3.42\%/decade). Notably, positive trends in drift speed are found in regions with reduced multiyear sea ice coverage. Over 90\% of the Arctic Ocean has positive trends in drift speed and negative trends in multiyear sea ice coverage. The increased responsiveness of ice drift to geostrophic wind is consistent with a thinner and weaker seasonal ice cover and suggests large-scale changes in the air-ice-ocean momentum balance. The retrieved mean ocean current field from decadal-scale average ice motion captures a steady drift from Siberia to the Fram Strait, an inflow north of the Bering Strait, and a westward drift along coastal Alaska. This mean current is comparable to geostrophic currents from satellite-derived dynamic topography.},

  abstract = {Polar microalgae live under extreme environmental conditions: permanently low temperatures (-1.7 degrees C to +5 degrees C) and extreme variations in irradiance and day length. These conditions may have led to various specific adaptations allowing Arctic phytoplankton to become specialists under these conditions. The goal of this study is to derive, for polar microalgae, empirical relationships between key physiological parameters (growth rate, photosynthesis-irradiance curve parameters, Chl a:C, and N:C ratios) and growth temperature and irradiance in nutrient replete cultures. Ecophysiological characteristics of polar and temperate microalgae were also compared in order to highlight some strategies that are specific to the polar environment. Most of the polar species are psychrophilic. Polar microalgae have low light-saturated growth rates ((m)) and very low light saturation parameters for growth (K-E) but similar initial slopes of their growth-irradiance curve ((mu)=(m)/K-E). Low temperatures probably account for low (m) and K-E in polar species. The C:Chl a ratios P-m(c) of polar species are similar to those of temperate species although they have much lower growth rates, which implies major differences in energy allocation. Polar microalgae also exhibit very unique photosynthetic properties [low light saturation parameters for photosynthesis (E-K), low maximum photosynthetic rates (P-m(c)), decreasing and decreasing initial slope of the photosynthesis vs. irradiance curve (alpha*) with increasing irradiance] and have lower C:N ratios than their temperate cousins, which may be related to a much higher protein content. Some of the implications of these findings in terms of adaptation/acclimation to the environment in which polar species evolve are discussed.},

Experimental data were collected in coastal waters of the Ebro river mouth area during two periods of non-bloom conditions and low suspended load. Examination of the reflectance spectra reveals a few significant shapes corresponding to different apparent colours and specific values of hydrological parameters. A colour classification is proposed. An empirical method and a semi-analytical method are presented in order to retrieve suspended particulate matter concentration, namely SPM, chlorophyll a concentration, chl, sediment refractive index, m(r), and absorption coefficient of yellow substance at 440 nm, a,(440). The first method is a direct application of the colour classification. It is based on correlations found for each water type between spectral features of the first derivative of reflectance and SPM, chl, m(r), a(y)(440) values. A second method uses the inversion of a three component reflectance model. Measured reflectance spectra and typical values of m(r), deduced from the colour classification, are assimilated in the model. As a result, it appears that estimates of SPM and chi are more accurate by calculating chl from the correlation technique and SPM along with a(y)(440) from inversion of the reflectance model.},

The second chapter offers insights into instrumentation for fluorescence spectroscopy with an introduction to devices such as spectrofluorimeters, lightsources, filters, and detectors. Further on different applica- tions of fluorescence spectroscopy are described explicitly. The measurement methods and the information one can gain from these are explained equally well. The description covers experiments such as life-time measurements, fluo- rescence-quenching, and energy-transfer experiments, fluo- rescence correlation spectroscopy, and life-time imaging microscopy. For all these topics one can find basic information and useful practical hints. Hence this book covers all topics related to fluorescence spectroscopy, starting with basic information and moving toward actual topics of research and application. Valuable information is also given in chapters dedicated to fluorophores. In these chapters common natural fluorophores, and novel fluoro- phores such as lanthanides, quantum dots, and metal\textendash ligand complexes are presented and their different properties are discussed. The book contains three appendices providing standard data and spectra in a clearly arranged overview. At the very end, answers to questions asked throughout the book are given and discussed. Another point to be stressed is the well selected, coloured figures which impart information precisely and in a straightforward manner.},

  abstract = {A new framework for measuring functional diversity (FD) from multiple traits has recently been proposed. This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence-absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the "FD" R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

  abstract = {Two satellite-based methods to estimate daily averaged photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) at the ocean surface are evaluated at high northern latitudes. The first method employs a precomputed Look-Up-Table (LUT) generated from radiative transfer simulations. The LUT associates spectral irradiance reaching the surface to a given set of input parameters, namely solar zenith angle, cloud optical thickness, cloud fraction, ozone concentration, and surface albedo. The second method, as implemented by NASA's Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) in the standard Ocean Color data processing chain, expresses the energy budget of the atmosphere-surface-ocean system via a simple radiative transfer model. The performance of these methods is evaluated using an extensive in situ PAR dataset collected in the Arctic Ocean between 1998 and 2014, with daily values ranging from 0.08 to 61.07 Em- 2 d- 1. A methodology is developed to compare in situ measurements and satellite products of different spatial and temporal resolution. Agreement is generally good between satellite-derived estimates and ship-based data and between methods. Specifically, both methods yield a small positive bias of 6\% and 2\% and a relative uncertainty larger than that observed at low latitude, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 33\% and 20\% for the LUT and OPBG methods, respectively. This is attributed to the peculiar environmental conditions encountered in the Arctic, namely low solar elevation, changing surface albedo due to sea ice, and persistent cloudiness. The RMSE difference among methods is due to the high temporal resolution (3 h) of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) LUT input not fully compensating for its low spatial resolution (280 km grid cells). The LUT method has the major advantage of providing PAR estimates in all conditions, including ice-covered regions, while the OBPG method is currently limited to open waters and a solar zenith angle lower than 83\textdegree. Consequently, the OBPG method may not account for as much as 38\% of PAR reaching the Arctic ocean surface annually. Both methods have the potential to provide useful PAR estimates just below the ice, by including information about ice transmittance.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. The characteristics of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) as well as the concentrations and stable isotope composition ({$\delta$} 13 C) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were characterized in several large rivers of Africa including the Congo, Niger, Zambezi, and Ogoou\'e basins. We compared the spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and quality along with various environmental gradients, including hydrology, river size, catchment vegetation, and connectivity to land. The optical proxies used include the absorption coefficient at 350 nm, the specific ultra-violet absorbance, and the spectral slope ratio (S R = 275\textendash 295-nm slope divided by 350\textendash 400-nm slope). Our results show that land cover plays a primary role in controlling both DOC concentration and optical properties of DOM in tropical freshwaters. A higher cover of dense forest in the catchment leads to a higher quantity of highly aromatic DOM in the river network, whereas an increasing savannah cover results in lower DOC concentrations and less absorptive DOM. In addition to land cover, the watershed morphology (expressed by the average slope) exerts a strong control on DOC and CDOM in tropical rivers. Our results also show that the percentage of C3 and C4 vegetation cover is not an accurate predictor for DOM and CDOM quality in rivers due to the importance of the spatial distribution of land cover within the drainage network. The comparison of our results with previously published CDOM data in temperate and high-latitude rivers highlights that DOM in tropical freshwaters is generally more aromatic, and shows a higher capacity for absorbing sunlight irradiance.},

However, downstream gradients and temporal variability in DOM fluxes and characteristics are poorly studied at the scale of large river basins, especially in tropical areas. Here, we report longitudinal patterns in DOM content and composition based on absorbance and fluorescence measurements along the Zambezi River and its main tributary, the Kafue River, during two hydrological seasons. During high-flow periods, a greater proportion of aromatic and humic DOM was mobilized along rivers due to the hydrological connectivity with wetlands, while low-flow periods were characterized by lower DOM content of less aromaticity resulting from loss of connectivity with wetlands, more efficient degradation of terrestrial DOM and enhanced autochthonous productivity. Changes in water residence time due to contrasting water discharge were found to modulate the fate of DOM along the river continuum. Thus, high water discharge promotes the transport of terrestrial DOM downstream relative to its degradation, while low water discharge enhances the degradation of DOM during its transport. The longitudinal evolution of DOM was also strongly impacted by a hydrological buffering effect in large reservoirs in which the seasonal variability of DOM fluxes and composition was strongly reduced.},

Samples were collected in the main river and its tributaries in the central part of the Basin during high waters (HW) and falling waters (FW) periods. The longitudinal increase in DOC concentrations and changes in DOM characteristics along the mainstem was found to differ between the two periods, especially because of greater photodegradation of terrestrial inputs from the DOM-rich waters from the Cuvette Centrale during FW as water residence time (WRT) increased. DOM degradation within the Congo Basin was found to result in the transition from aromatic to aliphatic DOM, resulting from the losses of aromatic compounds by photodegradation and the production of aliphatic compound by biological degradation. This study highlights that landscape properties and changes in WRT can play a major role on the functioning of river ecosystems in processing DOM during its downstream transformation in river networks.},

New approaches are thus needed for a better understanding of DOM reactivity and fate in aquatic systems.

A solvent-elimination interface was used to deposit DOM fractions onto a germanium disk that were then analyzed by FTIR. Samples included ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) and fulvic acids from the St. Lawrence Estuary and its tributaries. Results showed significant compositional changes with molecular size and origin, especially in UDOM. Larger fractions of UDOM contained more carbohydrates, amides, aromatics/alkenes and aliphatics, while smaller fractions contained more carboxylate and OH groups. Small marine molecules (500-900 Da) were also enriched in sulfate groups that appeared bound to UDOM. Large marine molecules were the most amide-rich fractions. Fulvic acids were enriched in carboxylate and OH groups, showed little changes in composition, and appeared similar to small terrigenous (riverine) UDOM even in marine water. This work shows that an HPLC-FTIR system is a powerful and complementary tool in the characterization of DOM. The compositional changes observed may explain the reported contrasting reactivity and fate of DOM having different size and origin.},

Initial melt pond formation was not lim- ited to low-lying areas, rather ponds formed at almost all premelt elevations. The subsequent evolution of melt pond coverage varied considerably between the 2 years owing to four principle, temporally variable factors. First, the range in premelt topographic relief was 0.5 m greater in 2011 (rougher surface) than in 2012 (smoother surface), such that a seasonal maximum pond coverage of 60\% and maximum hydraulic head of 204mmwere reached in 2011, versus 78\% and 138mmin 2012. A change in the meltwater balance (production minus drainage) caused the ponds to spread or recede over an area that was almost 90\% larger in 2012 than in 2011. Second, modification of the premelt topography was observed during mid-June, due to preferential melting under certain drainage channels. Some of the lowest-lying premelt areas were sub- sequently elevated above these deepening channels and unexpectedly became drained later in the season. Third, ice interior temperatures remained 1\textendash 2?C colder later into June in 2012 than in 2011, even though the ice was 0.35mthinner at melt onset, thereby delaying permeability increases in the ice that would allow vertical meltwater drainage to the ocean. Finally, surface melt was estimated to account for approximately 62\% of the net radiative flux to the sea ice cover during the melt season.},

  abstract = {Multiscale sea ice algae observations are fundamentally important for projecting changes to sea ice ecosystems, as the physical environment continues to change. In this study, we developed upon previously established methodologies for deriving sea ice-algal chlorophyll a concentrations (chl a) from spectral radiation measurements, and applied these to larger-scale spectral surveys. We conducted four different under-ice spectral measurements: irradiance, radiance, transmittance, and transflectance, and applied three statistical approaches: Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF), Normalized Difference Indices (NDI), and multi-NDI. We developed models based on ice core chl a and coincident spectral irradiance/transmittance (N = 49) and radiance/transflectance (N = 50) measurements conducted during two cruises to the central Arctic Ocean in 2011 and 2012. These reference models were ranked based on two criteria: mean robustness R2 and true prediction error estimates. For estimating the biomass of a large-scale data set, the EOF approach performed better than the NDI, due to its ability to account for the high variability of environmental properties experienced over large areas. Based on robustness and true prediction error, the three most reliable models, EOF-transmittance, EOF-transflectance, and NDI-transmittance, were applied to two remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and two Surface and Under-Ice Trawl (SUIT) spectral radiation surveys. In these larger-scale chl a estimates, EOF-transmittance showed the best fit to ice core chl a. Application of our most reliable model, EOF-transmittance, to an 85 m horizontal ROV transect revealed large differences compared to published biomass estimates from the same site with important implications for projections of Arctic-wide ice-algal biomass and primary production. \textcopyright{} 2016.

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.There is mounting evidence that multiyear ice (MYI) is a unique component of the Arctic Ocean and may play a more important ecological role than previously assumed. This study improves our understanding of the potential of MYI as a suitable habitat for sea ice algae on a pan-Arctic scale. We sampled sea ice cores from MYI and first-year sea ice (FYI) within the Lincoln Sea during four consecutive spring seasons. This included four MYI hummocks with a mean chl a biomass of 2.0 mg/m2, a value significantly higher than FYI and MYI refrozen ponds. Our results support the hypothesis that MYI hummocks can host substantial ice-algal biomass and represent a reliable ice-algal habitat due to the (quasi-) permanent low-snow surface of these features. We identified an ice-algal habitat threshold value for calculated light transmittance of 0.014\%. Ice classes and coverage of suitable ice-algal habitat were determined from snow and ice surveys. These ice classes and associated coverage of suitable habitat were applied to pan-Arctic CryoSat-2 snow and ice thickness data products. This habitat classification accounted for the variability of the snow and ice properties and showed an areal coverage of suitable ice-algal habitat within the MYI-covered region of 0.54 million km2 (8.5\% of total ice area). This is 27 times greater than the areal coverage of 0.02 million km2 (0.3\% of total ice area) determined using the conventional block-model classification, which assigns single-parameter values to each grid cell and does not account for subgrid cell variability. This emphasizes the importance of accounting for variable snow and ice conditions in all sea ice studies. Furthermore, our results indicate the loss of MYI will also mean the loss of reliable ice-algal habitat during spring when food is sparse and many organisms depend on ice-algae.},

  abstract = {Assessing the role of sea ice algal biomass and primary production for polar ecosystems remains challenging due to the strong spatio-temporal variability of sea ice algae. Therefore, the spatial representativeness of sea ice algal biomass and primary production sampling remains a key issue in large-scale models and climate change predictions of polar ecosystems. To address this issue, we presented two novel approaches to up-scale ice algal chl a biomass and net primary production estimates based on profiles covering distances of 100 to 1000s of meters. This was accomplished by combining ice core-based methods with horizontal under-ice spectral radiation profiling conducted in the central Arctic Ocean during summer 2012. We conducted a multi-scale comparison of ice-core based ice algal chl a biomass with two profiling platforms: a remotely operated vehicle and surface and under ice trawl (SUIT). Net primary production estimates were compared between ice cores and remotely operated vehicle surveys. Our results showed that ice core-based estimates of ice algal biomass and net primary production do not representatively capture the spatial variability compared to the remotely operated vehicle-based estimates, implying considerable uncertainties for pan-Arctic estimates based on ice core observations alone. Grouping sea ice cores based on region or ice type improved the representativeness. With only a small sample size, however, a high risk of obtaining non-representative estimates remains. Sea ice algal biomass estimates based on the dominant ice class alone showed a better agreement between ice core and remotely operated vehicle estimates. Grouping ice core measurements yielded no improvement in net primary production estimates, highlighting the importance of accounting for the spatial variability of both the chl a biomass and bottom-ice light in order to get representative estimates. Profile-based measurements of ice algae biomass identified sea ice ridges as an underappreciated component of the Arctic ecosystem because chl a biomass was significantly greater in this unique habitat. Sea ice ridges are not easily captured with ice coring methods and thus require more attention in future studies. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for designing an efficient and effective sea ice algal sampling program for the summer season.},

In the St. Lawrence River ETM, we pet-formed sampling cruises during August and October 2006 to test the hypothesis that advection of upstream algae is responsible for high phytoplankton biomass within the ETM. The ETM was situated at the freshwater end of the estuary, where salinity ranges from 0.06 to 1.10. This abrupt peak in turbidity (up to 89,9 and 49.5 nephelometer turbidity units [NTU] during August and October, respectively) coincides with peak chlorophyll a concentrations (54,8 and 22.9 mu g l(-1) during August and October, respectively); surface and depth concentrations were similar in the ETM and upstream, where the water column was vertically mixed. These biomasses represented an increase of {$>$} 1 order of magnitude compared to upstream and downstream sites, while no growth proximal factor such as light or nutrients could explain this pattern, Sulfur-stable isotopic ratios from planktonic algae in the ETM differed from those of local periphyton, but corresponded to those of attached algae grown upstream in freshwater. Phytoplankton community structures were similar throughout the salinity gradient, and the vast majority of identified algae corresponded to genera common to freshwater, ETM and downstream environments. This study provides evidence that the observed peak in phytoplankton biomass within the ETM is largely due to high inputs of phytoplankton from upstream freshwater, rather than to local growth.},

Using three dimensional fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), we characterized FDOM found in the St. Lawrence River (Lake Saint-Pierre, Qu,bec, Canada), and from macrophyte leaching experiments. Eight fluorescent components were identified, three of which were dominant in macrophyte experiments and were similar to protein-like, autochthonous fluorophores identified in previous studies. The remaining components corresponded to humic and fulvic acids, and a principal component analysis revealed that their distribution in Lake Saint-Pierre was different than that of protein-like fluorophores, suggesting a different origin. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon were strongly associated with the distribution of the allochthonous components. The distribution of protein-like FDOM in Lake Saint-Pierre matched that of macrophytes in the lake and the abundance of allochthonous FDOM was explained by the connectivity with the terrestrial ecosystem. Nearshore water masses carrying large loads of newly imported organic matter from proximal tributaries showed the maximum abundances and the older water masses, from the center of the lake, carried smaller quantities of terrestrial organic matter, thus originated mainly from Lake Ontario, several hundred kilometers upstream of Lake Saint-Pierre. This study demonstrates that macrophytes are a net source of protein-like FDOM and could represent an important supply of autochthonous DOM in shallow, productive environments.},

Here, via the analysis of hundreds of boreal lakes, rivers and wetlands in Canada, we show that, contrary to conventional assumptions, the proportion of biologically degradable dissolved organic carbon remains constant and the photochemical degradability increases with terrestrial influence. Thus, degradation potential increases with increasing amounts of terrestrial carbon. Our results provide empirical evidence of a strong causal link between dissolved organic carbon concentrations and aquatic fluxes of carbon dioxide, mediated by the degradation of land-derived organic carbon in aquatic ecosystems. Future shifts in the patterns of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon in inland waters thus have the potential to significantly increase aquatic carbon emissions across northern landscapes.},

During the late summers of 2005 and 2006, the abundance, cell size, nucleic acid content, and sinking velocity of free-living and particle-attached bacteria were studied simultaneously, using a new approach that combines the settling column method with flow cytometry. Biomass, production, and respiration of both types of bacteria were estimated using published models. Our results showed that particle-attached bacteria were, on average, twice as large as and contained 1.3 times more nucleic acid than free-living bacteria. Particle-attached bacteria also sank faster than predicted by Stoke's Law, with estimated sinking velocities comparable to those of chlorophyll a biomass and protist cells. Each individual cell of the particle-attached bacterial community had high carbon demand, but their low abundances ({$<$}3\% of total bacterial numbers) resulted in low total carbon demand. Therefore, the main contributors to POC recycling were found to be free-living bacteria using the non-sinking dissolved organic material, which is released from particles due to the hydrolytic activity of particle-attached bacteria.

The second one, stretching from 1980 up to now, being the most accentuated with a 10\% drop in the total series' interannual discharge (40 600 m(3) s(-1)). It has only been very recently, in 1990 that the river dropped to its lowest level of the century. The dates at which hydrological discontinuities appear, are observed to be globally similar within practically all of the tributaries studied, the most significant bring that of 1970, already well known in West Africa. During the second half of the century, these discontinuities occur roughly every ten years at the beginning of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Rainfall discontinuities are not as numerous as discharges ones. They separate homogeneous phases whose variations between them are less pronounced than that of those separated by discharges discontinuities. This underlines the major importance of the geographical location and of the physiographical characteristics of river basins on hydrological spatiotemporal variations. Lastly, we show that the effects of the recent drought are more visible and pronounced in the northern areas of this vast basin than in the southern ones. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In addition, we estimated watershed land cover and morphology to assess the possibility that other landscape variables could account for DOM differences between the two stream types. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon, its UVB absorbance, and its molar absorbtivity (absorbance per unit carbon) were all significantly lower in streams with upstream lakes than in streams with no lakes. Strong predictive relationships existed between upstream watershed metrics and stream DOM properties, but varied by season and the presence of upstream lakes. DOM quantity and UV-absorbing ability were related to different watershed metrics, with DOM quantity being strongly related to terrestrial watershed metrics, whereas UV-absorbing ability was most strongly related to percent water surface area. Upstream lakes strongly influence downstream DOM potentially because of their long water residence times, which could increase opportunities for DOM processing. Upstream lakes represent a strong landscape predictor of stream DOM properties that is not directly tied to terrestrial DOM sources and processing.},

One of the major problems with this technique is the inner-filter effect (IFE), i.e. absorption of light at both the excitation and emission wavelengths. The common solutions are to either dilute the sample or apply some form of mathematical correction, most often based on the measured absorbance of the sample. Since dilution is not always possible, e.g. in on-line or in situ EEM recordings, and corrections based on absorbance are hampered primarily by the use of a separate absorbance instrument, neither of these solutions is optimal. In this work, we propose a mathematical correction procedure based on the intensity of Raman scatter from water. This procedure was found to reduce the error after correction by up to 50\% in comparison with two absorbance correction procedures. Furthermore, it does not require the use of a separate absorbance measurement, and it is applicable to on-line and in situ EEM recordings, where the IFE would otherwise cause problems.

In larger, more heterogeneous catchments, stream water DOC dynamics are regulated by the combined effect of hydrological mechanisms and the proportion of ma- jor landscape elements, such aswetland and forested areas.Asa consequence, streams withheterogeneous catchments undergo a temporal switch in the DOC source. In a typical boreal catchment covered by 10-20\% wetlands, DOC originates predominantly from wetland sources during low flow conditions. During high flow, the major source of DOC is from forested areas of the catchment.Wedemonstrate that by connecting knowledge about DOC sources in the landscape with detailed hydrological process under- standing, animprovedrepresentationof streamwater DOC regulation can be provided. The purpose of this study is to serve as a framework for appreciating the role of regulating mechanisms, connectivity and scalingforunderstandingthepatternanddynamicsof surface water DOC across complex landscapes. The results from this study suggest that the sensitivity of streamwaterDOC in the boreal landscape ultimately depends on changes within individual landscape elements, the proportion and connectivity of these affected landscape elements, and how these changes are propagated downstream.},

  abstract = {Landscape genetics is being increasingly applied to elucidate the role of environmental features on the population structure of terrestrial organisms. However, the potential of this framework has been little explored in aquatic ecosystems such as large rivers. Here, we used a landscape genetics approach in order to (i) document the population structure of the yellow perch (Perca flavescens) by means of genetic variation at microsatellite markers, (ii) assess to what extent the structure was explained by landscape heterogeneity, and (iii) interpret the relevance of interactions between genetics and landscape for management and conservation. Analysis of the genetic variation among 1715 individuals from 16 localities and distributed over 310 km in the freshwater section of the Saint Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada) revealed a relatively modest level of genetic structuring (F(ST) = 0.039). Application of the Monmonier's algorithm combining geographical and genetic information identified three zones of restricted gene flow defining four distinct populations. Physical barriers played a more important role on gene flow and genetic structure than waterway geographical distance. We found correlations between genetic differentiation and presence of distinct water masses in the sector of Lake Saint-Louis (r = 0.7177, P = 0.0340) and with fragmentation of spawning habitats in the sector of Lake Saint-Pierre (r = 0.8578, P = 0.0095). Our results support the treatment of four distinct biological units, which is in contrast with the current basis for yellow perch management. Finally, this study showed that landscape genetics is a powerful means to identify environmental barriers to gene flow causing genetic discontinuities in apparently highly connected aquatic landscapes.},

The productivity of the bottom sea ice algae and phytoplankton at Barrow in 2003 was limited mainly by low light levels (approximately 0.3\% of the surface irradiance) at the bottom under the snow-covered sea ice. The carbon and nitrate uptake rates of ice algae and phytoplankton increased as the incubation depth in the ice hole decreased and light intensity increased. In addition, under higher light conditions, the relative production of proteins of the bottom ice algae decreased, whereas the lipid proportion increased. The higher level of lipid synthesis of the ice algae might be significant to the nutrition of zooplankton and benthos because lipids are the most energy-dense biomolecules.},

On the basis of these differences, we hypothesized that UV avoidance behavior would be greatest in zooplankton with low UV tolerance, particularly in high-UV systems. Both downward and upward movements of zooplankton were examined in cylindrical acrylic columns that either transmitted full sunlight or blocked UV-B and short wavelength UV-A radiation. Columns were suspended vertically in the surface waters of a high- and low-UV lake at varying times of day and cloud cover. In the high-UV lake, the cladoceran Daphnia catawba displayed a distinct avoidance of the surface waters in the UV+ treatment but often showed a preference for the surface in the UV- treatment. Copepods were less responsive to UVR with calanoids displaying a somewhat greater UV avoidance than cyclopoids. In the low-UV lake, no behavioral differences were observed among UV treatments. These results suggest that UVR may influence the vertical distribution and habitat partitioning of certain zooplankton taxa in high-UV lakes while other factors, such as predation and food limitation, may be more important in low-UV lakes.},

However, in clear-water systems, ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UVR) may also influence fish predation, directly through UV-enhanced foraging, indirectly through alterations in predator-prey overlap, or in a combination of the two. Here we test the hypothesis that UVR facilitates fish predation on zooplankton in an oligotrophic lake. Experiments were conducted in 2.2-m-long UV-transparent or UV-blocking columns suspended in the epilimnion. Zooplankton consumption by young-of-the-year (YOY) largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) was compared in the presence and absence of UVR, and the vertical distributions of prey were quantified across light and fish treatments. In addition, a separate experiment was conducted to examine zooplankton vertical responses to UV exposure vs. fish kairomones. Overall, YOY predation on zooplankton was higher in the presence than in the absence of UVR, particularly on diaptomid copepods. This result was only partially explained by zooplankton migratory behaviors, suggesting UV-enhanced searching capabilities in YOY bass. Furthermore, diaptomids displayed a stronger vertical behavioral response to fish kairomones than to UVR whereas Daphnia exhibited a stronger response to UVR.},

We compiled extensive historical (1954\textendash 2012) data on discharge and nutrient concentrations to estimate fluxes of nitrate, soluble reactive phosphate (SRP), silicate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and particulate organic carbon (POC) from 9 large Arctic rivers and assess their potential impact on the biogeochemistry of shelf waters.

In some areas of the Beaufort Sea, the stronger haline stratification observed in summer alters the plankton ecosystem structure, functioning and productivity, promoting oligotrophy. A one-dimension (1-D) physical\textendash biological coupled model based on the large multiparametric database of the Malina project in the Beaufort Sea was used (i) to infer the plankton ecosystem functioning and related nitrogen fluxes and (ii) to assess the model sensitivity to key light-driven processes involved in nutrient recycling and phytoplankton growth. The coupled model suggested that ammonium photochemically produced from photosensitive dissolved organic nitrogen (i.e., photoammonification process) was a necessary nitrogen source to achieve the observed levels of microbial biomass and production. Photoammonification directly and indirectly (by stimulating the microbial food web activity) contributed to 70\% and 18.5\% of the 0\textendash 10 m and whole water column, respectively, simulated primary production (respectively 66\% and 16\% for the bacterial production). The model also suggested that variable carbon to chlorophyll ratios were required to simulate the observed herbivorous versus microbial food web competition and realistic nitrogen fluxes in the Beaufort Sea oligotrophic waters. In face of accelerating Arctic warming, more attention should be paid in the future to the mechanistic processes involved in food webs and functional group competition, nutrient recycling and primary production in poorly productive waters of the AO, as they are expected to expand rapidly.}

The paper discusses first how autocorrelation in ecological variables can be described and measured, with emphasis on mapping techniques. Then, proper statistical testing in the presence of autocorrelation is briefly discussed. Finally, ways are presented of explicitly introducing spatial structures into ecological models.

Tests of significance of the individual canonical axes in redundancy analysis allow researchers to determine which of the axes represent variation that can be distinguished from random. Variation along the significant axes can be mapped, used to draw biplots or interpreted through subsequent analyses, whilst the nonsignificant axes may be dropped from further consideration. 2. Three methods have been implemented in computer programs to test the significance of the canonical axes; they are compared in this paper. The simultaneous test of all individual canonical axes, which is appealing because of its simplicity, produced incorrect (highly inflated) levels of type I error for the axes following those corresponding to true relationships in the data, so it is invalid. The marginal testing method implemented in the vegan R package and the forward testing method implemented in the program CANOCO were found to have correct levels of type I error and comparable power. Permutation of the residuals achieved greater power than permutation of the raw data. 3. R functions found in a Supplement to this paper provide the first formal description of the marginal and forward testing methods.},

This phenomenon is described and two solutions are proposed. The first solution is to apportion the intersection fractions proportionally to the variation explained by each submodel. The second solution consists in creating a hierarchy among the spatial submodels, in accordance with hierarchy theory. These solutions lead to new partitioning equations that are described in the Appendix. R functions are provided to carry out partitioning with respect to environmental variables and spatial eigenfunction submodels. This development is important for the correct interpretation of spatial modeling results implying explanatory environmental data as well as submodels of spatial eigenfunctions involving two or more spatial scales.},

These methods are illustrated with ecological data from 13 years of benthic surveys in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The following methods are applied to the Chesapeake data: distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps, asymmetric eigenvector maps, scalogram, variation partitioning, multivariate correlogram, multivariate regression tree, and two-way MANOVA to study temporal and space-time variability. Local (temporal) contributions to beta diversity (LCBD indices) are computed and analysed graphically and by regression against environmental variables, and the role of species in determining the LCBD values is analysed by correlation analysis. A tutorial detailing the analyses in the R language is provided in an appendix.},

We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

Researchers are realizing that individual communities and ecosystems are not isolated from each other but rather that they are connected by exchanges of individuals (through dispersal) and materials (through spatial fluxes). From a conceptual perspective, there is a need to develop theories and hypotheses about the roles of these exchanges on different community and ecosystem attributes. Here we focus on the concept of metacommunities, to address how plankton communities are structured and how this may generate patterns of variation in planktonic ecosystems. Our premise is that planktonic systems can be understood in the framework of metacommunities and that the regulation of these metacommunities alter how they work as "complex adaptive systems." We hypothesize that connectivity through dispersal of local communities that are embedded in aquatic metacommunities show a range of dynamic behaviors related to their capacity to respond adaptively to environmental change.},

Without substantial tributary inflow, maintenance demands exceeded algal production during summer and autumn in this eutrophic, 'lowland type' river due to light-limiting conditions for algal growth. Streamflow from tributaries that drain the Sierra Nevada contributed to a substantial net gain in algal production during the spring and summer by increasing water transparency and the extent of turbulence. Abundances of the major taxa (centric diatoms, pennate diatoms and chlorophytes) indicated differing responses to the longitudinal variation in water depth and flow regime, with the areal extent of pools and other geomorphic features that influence time-for-development being a major contributing factor to the selection of species. Tychoplanktonic species were most abundant upstream and in tributaries that drain the San Joaquin Valley. Seasonally-varying factors such as water temperature that influence algal growth rates also contributed significantly to the selection of species. Nutrient limitation appears not to be a primary constraint on species selection in the phytoplankton of this river.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a reduced model strategy for simulation of complex physical systems. A classical reduced basis is first constructed relying on proper orthogonal decomposition of the system. Then, unlike the alternative approaches, such as Galerkin projection schemes for instance, an equation-free reduced model is constructed. It consists in the determination of an explicit transformation, or mapping, for the evolution over a coarse time-step of the projection coefficients of the system state on the reduced basis. The mapping is expressed as an explicit polynomial transformation of the projection coefficients and is computed once and for all in a pre-processing stage using the detailed model equation of the system. The reduced system can then be advanced in time by successive applications of the mapping. The CPU cost of the method lies essentially in the mapping approximation which is performed offline, in a parallel fashion, and only once. Subsequent application of the mapping to perform a time-integration is carried out at a low cost thanks to its explicit character. Application of the method is considered for the 2-D flow around a circular cylinder. We investigate the effectiveness of the reduced model in rendering the dynamics for both asymptotic state and transient stages. It is shown that the method leads to a stable and accurate time-integration for only a fraction of the cost of a detailed simulation, provided that the mapping is properly approximated and the reduced basis remains relevant for the dynamics investigated.

However, uncertainties in L w {$\lambda$} arising from the extrapolation process have not been investigated in detail with regards to the potential influence of inelastic radiative processes, such as Raman scattering by water mol-ecules and fluorescence by colored dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll-a. Using radiative transfer simula-tions, we examine high-depth resolution vertical profiles of the upwelling radiance, L u {$\lambda$}, and its diffuse attenuation coefficient, K L u {$\lambda$}, within the top 10 m of the ocean surface layer and assess the uncertainties in extrapolated values of L w {$\lambda$}. The inelastic processes generally increase L u and decrease K L u in the red and near-infrared (NIR) portion of the spectrum. Unlike K L u in the blue and green spectral bands, K L u in the red and NIR is strongly variable within the near-surface layer even in a perfectly homogeneous water column. The assumption of a constant K L u with depth that is typically employed in the extrapolation method can lead to significant errors in the estimate of L w . These errors approach {$\sim$}100\% at 900 nm, and the desired threshold of 5\% accuracy or less cannot be achieved at wavelengths greater than 650 nm for underwater radiometric systems that typically take measurements at depths below 1 m. These errors can be reduced by measuring L u within a much shallower surface layer of tens of centimeters thick or even less at near-infrared wavelengths longer than 800 nm, which suggests a requirement for developing appropriate radiometric instrumentation and deployment strategies.

  abstract = {Abstract. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the Pearl River estuary (PRE) of China was measured in May, August, and October 2015 and January 2016. Chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (CDOM and FDOM) in the latter three seasons were characterized by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. CDOM and FDOM exhibited negligible seasonal variations, while DOC displayed a significant seasonality, with the average concentration being highest in May (156 \textmu mol L-1), lowest in November (87 \textmu mol L-1), and comparable between January (118 \textmu mol L-1) and August (112 \textmu mol L-1). Although DOC, CDOM, and FDOM in surface water were generally higher than in bottom water, the difference between the two layers was statistically insignificant. DOC showed little cross-estuary variations in all seasons, while CDOM and FDOM in January were higher on the west side of the estuary than on the east side. All three variables showed rapid drawdowns in the head region of the estuary (salinity {$<$}5); their dynamics in the main estuary were primarily controlled by conservative mixing, leading to linearly declining or relatively constant (for DOC in May and November only) contents with increasing salinity. The decrease in FDOM with salinity was 5 \%\textendash 35 \% faster than that of CDOM, which in turn was 2\textendash 3 times quicker than that of DOC. Salinity and CDOM absorption coefficients could serve as indicators of DOC in August and January. Freshwater endmembers in all seasons mainly contained fresh, protein-rich DOM of microbial origin, a large part of it likely being pollution-derived. Protein-like materials were preferentially consumed in the head region but the dominance of the protein signature was maintained throughout the estuary. Exports of DOC and CDOM (in terms of the absorption coefficient at 330 nm) into the South China Sea were estimated as 195\texttimes 109 g and 266\texttimes 109 m2 for the PRE and 362\texttimes 109 g and 493\texttimes 109 m2 for the entire Pearl River Delta. The PRE presents the lowest concentrations and export fluxes of DOC and CDOM among the world's major estuaries. DOM delivered from the PRE is, however, protein-rich and thus may enhance heterotrophs in the adjacent coastal waters. Overall, the PRE manifests lower abundance and smaller spatiotemporal variability of DOM than expected for a sizable estuary with a marked seasonality of river runoff due supposedly to the poorly forested watershed of the Pearl River, the rapid degradation of the pollution-derived DOM in the upper reach, and the short residence time of freshwater. ]]{$>$}},

  abstract = {The partitioning of incident solar radiation between sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere strongly affects the Arctic energy balance during summer. In addition to spectral albedo of the ice surface, transmission of solar radiation through the ice is critical for assessing heat and mass balances of sea ice. Observations of spectral irradiance profiles within and transmittance through ice in the Beaufort Sea during the summer of 1998 during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) are presented. Sites representative of melting multiyear and first-year ice, along with ponded ice were measured. Observed spectral irradiance extinction coefficients (Kl) show broad minima near 500 nm and strong increases at near-infrared wavelengths. The median Kl at 600 nm for the bare ice cases is close to 0.8 m 1 and about 0.6 m 1 for ponded ice. Values are considerably smaller than the previously accepted value of 1.5 m 1 . Radiative transfer models were used to analyze the observations and obtain inherent optical properties of the ice. Derived scattering coefficients range from 500 m 1 to 1100 m 1 in the surface layer and 8 to 30 m 1 in the ice interior. While ponded ice is known to transmit a significant amount of shortwave radiation to the ocean, the irradiance transmitted through bare, melting ice is also shown to be significant. The findings of this study predict 3\textendash 10 times more solar radiation penetrating the ice cover than predicted by a current GCM (CCSM3) parameterization, depending on ice thickness, pond coverage, stage of the melt season, and specific vertical scattering coefficient profile.},

  abstract = {The magnitude, spectral composition, and variability of the Arctic sea ice surface albedo are key to understanding and numerically simulating Earth's shortwave energy budget. Spectral and broadband albedos of Arctic sea ice were spatially and temporally sampled by on-ice observers along individual survey lines throughout the sunlit season (April\textendash September, 2020) during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. The seasonal evolution of albedo for the MOSAiC year was constructed from spatially averaged broadband albedo values for each line. Specific locations were identified as representative of individual ice surface types, including accumulated dry snow, melting snow, bare and melting ice, melting and refreezing ponded ice, and sediment-laden ice. The area-averaged seasonal progression of total albedo recorded during MOSAiC showed remarkable similarity to that recorded 22 years prior on multiyear sea ice during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) expedition. In accord with these and other previous field efforts, the spectral albedo of relatively thick, snow-free, melting sea ice shows invariance across location, decade, and ice type. In particular, the albedo of snow-free, melting seasonal ice was indistinguishable from that of snow-free, melting second-year ice, suggesting that the highly scattering surface layer that forms on sea ice during the summer is robust and stabilizing. In contrast, the albedo of ponded ice was observed to be highly variable at visible wavelengths. Notable temporal changes in albedo were documented during melt and freeze onset, formation and deepening of melt ponds, and during melt evolution of sediment-laden ice. While model simulations show considerable agreement with the observed seasonal albedo progression, disparities suggest the need to improve how the albedo of both ponded ice and thin, melting ice are simulated.},

  abstract = {In the Arctic Ocean, sea ice algae are responsible for a small but seasonally important pulse of primary production. Their persistence is threatened by the rapid loss of sea ice from the Arctic Ocean due to climate change, but this threat will be at least partially offset by the replacement of multiyear ice (MYI) with first-year ice (FYI). FYI is thinner and usually features a thinner snow cover than MYI, thus transmitting more light to support ice algal growth. We combined remote sensing, reanalysis data, and modeling products with a radiative transfer model to assess how the changing physical conditions in the Arctic altered the extent and duration of the bottom ice algal habitat over a 34-year period. Habitat was defined as areas where enough light penetrates to the bottom ice to support net positive photosynthesis. The Arctic shifted from 37\% FYI in 1985 to 63\% in 2018, as the 2.0 \texttimes{} 106 km2 increase in FYI extent outpaced the 0.6 \texttimes{} 106 km2 decrease in overall sea ice extent above the Arctic Circle. The proliferation of younger ice corresponded with a 0.08 m decade\textendash 1 decrease in average sea ice thickness and a 0.003 m decade\textendash 1 decrease in average snow depth. The end of the ice algal season, marked by the onset of warm summer air temperatures, moved slightly earlier, by 1.4 days decade\textendash 1. Our analysis indicates that ice algal habitat extent increased by 0.4 \texttimes{} 106 km2 decade\textendash 1, or from 48\% to 66\% of total sea ice extent. The average ice algal growing season also lengthened by 2.4 days and shifted earlier in the year. Together, these trends suggest that net primary production in Arctic sea ice increased during 1985\textendash 2018. The most dramatic changes were localized in the Central Basin and the Chukchi Sea and were driven primarily by the declining snow cover and the shift from MYI to FYI. Although the Arctic recently became more favorable to ice algae, we expect that this trend will not continue indefinitely, as a limited amount of MYI remains.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The effects of climate change on Arctic marine ecosystems and their biogeochemical cycles are difficult to predict given the complex physical, biological and chemical interactions among the ecosystem components. We studied benthic biogeochemical fluxes in the Arctic and the influence of short-term (seasonal to annual), long-term (annual to decadal) and other environmental variability on their spatial distribution to provide a baseline for estimates of the impact of future changes. In summer 2009, we measured fluxes of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, soluble reactive phosphate and silicic acid at the sediment\textendash water interface at eight sites in the southeastern Beaufort Sea at water depths from 45 to 580 m. The spatial pattern of the measured benthic boundary fluxes was heterogeneous. Multivariate analysis of flux data showed that no single or reduced combination of fluxes could explain the majority of spatial variation, indicating that oxygen flux is not representative of other nutrient sink\textendash source dynamics. We tested the influence of eight environmental parameters on single benthic fluxes. Short-term environmental parameters (sinking flux of particulate organic carbon above the bottom, sediment surface Chl a) were most important for explaining oxygen, ammonium and nitrate fluxes. Long-term parameters (porosity, surface manganese and iron concentration, bottom water oxygen concentrations) together with {$\delta$}13Corg signature explained most of the spatial variation in phosphate, nitrate and nitrite fluxes. Variation in pigments at the sediment surface was most important to explain variation in fluxes of silicic acid. In a model including all fluxes synchronously, the overall spatial distribution could be best explained (57\%) by the combination of sediment Chl a, phaeopigments, {$\delta$}13Corg, surficial manganese and bottom water oxygen concentration. We conclude that it is necessary to consider long-term environmental variability along with rapidly ongoing environmental changes to predict the flux of oxygen and nutrients across Arctic sediments even at short timescales. Our results contribute to improve ecological models predicting the impact of climate change on the functioning of marine ecosystems.}

When used with a sensitive photometer, absolute values for the ambient light field can be determined within and immediately under the ice. As anticipated, attenuation is greatest at the ice-air interface; values just below the ice surface were 3 to 20 per cent of incident. Another 70 to 100 cm. of ice was required to effect a further 50 per cent decrease in illumination. Extinction values were also measured on the ice cores in the laboratory, but scattering greatly complicates the interpretation of laboratory results. /// A l'occasion d'\'etudes sur le phytoplancton, les auteurs ont mis au point un instrument non optique et non \'electrique qui mesure l'intensit\'e lumineuse relative dans des trous for\'es dans la glace de mer.

  abstract = {Fungal load quantification is a critical component of fungal community analyses. Limitation of current approaches for quantifying the fungal component in the human microbiome suggests the need for new broad-coverage techniques. We analyzed 2,085 18S rRNA gene sequences from the SILVA database for assay design. We generated and quantified plasmid standards using a qPCR-based approach. We evaluated assay coverage against 4,968 sequences and performed assay validation following the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines. We designed FungiQuant, a TaqMan\textregistered{} qPCR assay targeting a 351 bp region in the fungal 18S rRNA gene. Our in silico analysis showed that FungiQuant is a perfect sequence match to 90.0\% of the 2,617 fungal species analyzed. We showed that FungiQuant's is 100\% sensitive and its amplification efficiencies ranged from 76.3\% to 114.5\%, with r(2)-values of \textquestiondown 0.99 against the 69 fungal species tested. Additionally, FungiQuant inter- and intra-run coefficients of variance ranged from \textexclamdown 10\% and \textexclamdown 20\%, respectively. We further showed that FungiQuant has a limit of quantification 25 copies and a limit of detection at 5 copies. Lastly, by comparing results from human-only background DNA with low-level fungal DNA, we showed that amplification in two or three of a FungiQuant performed in triplicate is statistically significant for true positive fungal detection. FungiQuant has comprehensive coverage against diverse fungi and is a robust quantification and detection tool for delineating between true fungal detection and non-target human DNA.},

  abstract = {We explore patterns of diversity of plant functional types (PFTs) in Mediterranean communities subjected to landscape-scale fire disturbances in a mosaic of uncultivated and old fields stands. We use regenerative and growth form attributes to establish two sets of PFTs of perennial species living in shrublands and pine forests of NE Spain. We test the following hypotheses: 1. Fire frequency decreases regenerative PFTs diversity by negatively selecting attributes with low regenerative efficiency. 2. Fire history has more influence on regenerative than on growth form PFTs. 3. The lowest diversity of growth form PFTs will be in old fields without recent fires. We surveyed stands of different combinations of fire and land use histories. Fire history included areas without fires in the last twenty years (unburned), sites burned in 1982 (1-burned), and sites burned in 1982 and 1994 (2-burned). Land use histories considered terraced old fields, and uncultivated stands on stony soils. We analysed patterns of PFT abundance and diversity at the stand level, and across the landscape (among stands absolute deviations from sample medians of the relative cover of PFTs). At the stand level, fire had more influence on the diversity patterns of regenerative PFTs than on growth form PFT. Fire decreased the diversity of regenerative PFTs, due to the elimination of the species without effective mechanisms to post-fire regeneration. This effect was not observed across the landscape, but seeders showed more variation in stands with longer history without fire. Land use contributed to explain the diversity patterns of growth form PFT (i.e. the number of growth form PFTs was lower in uncultivated, unburned sites), but it did not influence regenerative PFTs diversity. Patterns of PFTs diversity reflect the response to ecological processes operating at the landscape level. Overall, regenerative and growth form PFTs appear to be more sensitive to the fire history than to the past land use.},

  abstract = {Knowledge on absorption by colored dissolved organic matter, a(cdom), spatio-temporal variability in coastal areas is of fundamental importance in many field of researches related to biogeochemical cycles studies, coastal areas management, as well as land and water interactions in the coastal domain. A new method, based on the theoretical link between the vertical attenuation coefficient, K(d), and the absorption coefficient, has been developed to assess a(cdom). This method, confirmed from radiative transfer simulations and in situ measurements, and tested on an independent in situ data set (N = 126), allows a(cdom) to be assessed with a Mean Relative Absolute Difference, MRAD, of 33\% over two order of magnitude (from 0.01 to 1.16 m(-1)). In the frame of ocean color observation, K(d) is not directly measured but estimated from the remote sensing reflectance, R(rs). Based on 109 satellite (SeaWiFS) and in situ coincident (i.e. match-up) data points a(cdom) is retrieved with a MRAD value of 37\%. This simple model generally presents slightly better performances than recently developed empirical or semi-analytical algorithms.},

Compared with the common methods where a single slope of CDOM absorption spectrum is determined over a broad spectral region, we estimate the variations in spectral slope as a function of wavelength from 200 to 700 nm. Hence, our results show a distribution of spectral slope, referred to as the spectral slope curve, S(lambda), which was used to identify similarities between lakes and standard solutions as well as to show the wavelength intervals in which photodegradation modifies spectral slope. In contrast to the plethora of wavelength intervals and ratios presented in the CDOM literature, a comparison of spectral slope curves between ecosystems provides a potentially important tool to examine the characteristics of CDOM in a consistent manner.},

  abstract = {The underwater light conditions in the African Great Lakes depend on the complex dynamics of ecological and hydrological forces, and are strongly influenced by local environmental conditions and global biogeochemical cycles. Changes in the optical conditions in these lakes have direct impacts on ecosystem productivity, carbon dynamics and nutrient availability. A central role in the underwater light climate is played by dissolved organic matter which is present in all aquatic ecosystems. The chromophoric fraction of these compounds can mediate ecosystem change through its influence on the attenuation of ultraviolet and PAR radiation, microbial carbon cycling and radiative transfer. In the African Great Lakes, little information is available regarding the dynamics of dissolved organic matter and those sources and sinks which control its presence in the water column. We present an extensive spatial analysis of three major bays on the Kenyan and Ugandan shores of Lake Victoria. We use these data to examine the dynamics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in different bays and we develop a model to estimate its flow from these bays to the Lake, considering both conservative mixing and photodegradation processes. While some bays release chromophoric dissolved organic matter practically unmodified into the Lake, increased residence time and exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation create conditions where chromophores are lost before entering the open lake.},

  abstract = {The bioavailability and bacterial degradation rates of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were determined over a seasonal cycle in Loch Cretan (Scotland) by measuring the decrease in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorous (DOP) concentrations during long-term laboratory incubations (150 days) at a constant temperature of 14 degrees C. The experiments showed that bioavailable DOC (BDOC) accounted for 29 +/- 11\% of DOC (average SD). bioavailable DON (BDON) for 52 +/- 11\% of DON and bioavailable DOP (BDOP) for 88 8\% of DOP. The seasonal variations in DOM concentrations were mainly due to the bioavailable fraction. BDOP was degraded at a rate of 12 +/- 4\% d(-1) (average +/- SD) while the degradation rates of BDOC and BDON were 7 +/- 2\% d(-1) and 9 +/- 2\% d(-1) respectively, indicating a preferential mineralization of DOP relative to DON and of DON relative to DOC. Positive correlations between concentration and degradation rate of DOM suggested that the higher the concentration the faster DOM would be degraded. On average, 77 +/- 9\% of BDOR 62 +/- 14\% of BDON and 49 +/- 19\% of BDOC were mineralized during the residence time of water in Loch Creran, showing that this coastal area exported C-rich DOM to the adjacent Firth of Lorne. Four additional degradation experiments testing the effect of varying temperature on bioavailability and degradation rates of DOM were also conducted throughout the seasonal cycle (summer, autumn, winter and spring). Apart from the standard incubations at 14 degrees C, additional studies at 8 degrees C and 18 degrees C were also conducted. Bioavailability did not change with temperature, but degradation rates were stimulated by increased temperature, with a Q(10) of 2.6 +/- 1.1 for DOC and 2.5 +/- 0.7 for DON (average +/- SD).

Therefore, this study confirms that the CDOM fluorescence at peak-T can be used as a proxy to a DOM fraction significantly more labile than the bulk bioavailable DOC. In parallel with the decay of DOC and protein-like fluorescence, an increase in CDOM fluorescence at peak-M (Ex/Em, 320/410 nm) during the course of the incubations verified the production of marine humic-like substances as a by-product of the microbial metabolism. CDOM fluorescence at peak-M built-up at a production rate (kM) of 0.06 ?? 0.01 day- 1 (average ?? SD) in the R??a de Vigo. Furthermore, the slope of the linear regression between kDOC and kM (R2 = 0.64, p {$<$} 0.001) revealed that the formation of marine humic-like substances occurred at about one fifth of the rate of net DOC consumption. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The bioavailable fraction (BDOM) represented 17 +/- 6\% (average +/- SE) of DOC, 38 +/- 6\% of DON and 65 +/- 9\% of DOP. BDOM was significantly correlated with temperature (R(2) {$>$} 0.3, p {$<$} 0.05) and chlorophyll a (R(2) {$>$} 0.5, p {$<$} 0.05), indicating that the differences in DOM bioavailability were associated with the seasonal variations in plankton biomass and activity. The C:N:P stoichiometry of BDOM, 111 ( 38):18 ( 6):l, was not significantly different from the Redfield ratio (106:16:1), pointing to a phytoplankton origin of BDOM. Accordingly, exponential rate constants of BDOM suggest that this pool is very labile. Despite the reduced flushing times of the Ria de Vigo, from 3 to 8 d, as much as 70 +/- 13 \% of BDOC (average +/- SD), 81 +/- 8 \% of BDON and 88 +/- 5 \% of BDOP are mineralized within the embayment. The remaining C-rich BDOM is exported to the adjacent oligotrophic waters, suggesting that the offshore transport of labile DOM must be accounted for when considering the carbon balance of ocean surface waters adjacent to productive coastal areas.},

Shaped by natural forces since its origin 7,500 years ago, humans gradually gained dominance in influencing ecosystem structure and functioning. Here, we reconstruct the timeline of human impacts and the history of ecological changes in the Wadden Sea. We then discuss the ecosystem and societal consequences of observed changes, and conclude with management implications. Human influences have intensified and multiplied over time. Large-scale habitat transformation over the last 1,000 years has eliminated diverse terrestrial, freshwater, brackish and marine habitats. Intensive exploitation of everything from oysters to whales has depleted most large predators and habitat-building species since medieval times. In the twentieth century, pollution, eutrophication, species invasions and, presumably, climate change have had marked impacts on the Wadden Sea flora and fauna. Yet habitat loss and overexploitation were the two main causes for the extinction or severe depletion of 144 species (similar to 20\% of total macrobiota). The loss of biodiversity, large predators, special habitats, filter and storage capacity, and degradation in water quality have led to a simplification and homogenisation of the food web structure and ecosystem functioning that has affected the Wadden Sea ecosystem and coastal societies alike. Recent conservation efforts have reversed some negative trends by enabling some birds and mammals to recover and by creating new economic options for society. The Wadden Sea history provides a unique long-term perspective on ecological change, new objectives for conservation, restoration and management, and an ecological baseline that allows us to envision a rich, productive and diverse Wadden Sea ecosystem and coastal society.},

These trends may be due to changes in the way ecol- ogy is studied or in the way the findings of investigations are reported.

In this study, the second of a 2-paper series, we use a depth-averaged hydrodynamic-biological model to identify transport-related mechanisms impacting phytoplankton biomass accumulation and distribution on a system level. We chose South San Francisco Bay as a model domain. since its combination of a deep channel surrounded by broad shoals is typical of drowned-river estuaries. Five general mechanisms involving interaction of horizontal transport with variability in local conditions are discussed. Residual (on the order of days to weeks) transport mechanisms affecting bloom development and location include residence time/export, import, and the role of deep channel regions as conduits for mass transport. Interactions occurring on tidal time scales, i.e. (on the order of hours) include the phasing of lateral oscillatory tidal flow relative to temporal changes in local net phytoplankton growth rates, as well as lateral sloshing of shoal-derived biomass into deep channel regions during ebb and back into shallow regions during flood tide. Based on these results, we conclude that: (1) while local conditions control whether a bloom is possible, the combination of transport and spatial-temporal variability in local conditions determines if and where a bloom will actually occur; (2) tidal-time-scale physical-biological interactions provide important mechanisms for bloom development and evolution. As a result of both subtidal and tidal-time-scale transport processes. peak biomass may not be observed where local conditions are most favorable to phytoplankton production, and inherently unproductive areas may be regions of high biomass accumulation.},

  abstract = {Transport time scales such as flushing time and residence time are often used to explain variability in phytoplankton biomass. In many cases, empirical data are consistent with a positive phytoplankton-transport time relationship (i.e., phytoplankton biomass increases as transport time increases). However, negative relationships, varying relationships, or no significant relationship may also be observed. We present a simple conceptual model, in both mathematical and graphical form, to help explain why phytoplankton may have a range of relationships with transport time, and we apply it to several real systems. The phytoplankton growth-loss balance determines whether phytoplankton biomass increases with, decreases with, or is insensitive to transport time. If algal growth is faster than loss (e. g., grazing, sedimentation), then phytoplankton biomass increases with increasing transport time. If loss is faster than growth, phytoplankton biomass decreases with increasing transport time. If growth and loss are approximately balanced, then phytoplankton biomass is relatively insensitive to transport time. In analyses of several systems, portions of an individual system, or time periods, apparent insensitivity of phytoplankton biomass to changes in transport time could arise due to the superposition of cases with different phytoplankton-transport time relationships. Thus, in order to understand or predict responses of phytoplankton biomass to changes in transport time, the relative rates of algal growth and loss must be known.},

The ROV is designed for deployments and measurements of the irradiance field at a short distance below sea ice bottom in landfast level sea ice at calm under ice conditions. It is equipped with two cameras (front and rear) for optical positioning based on reference poles with LED lights below the ice. A third upward camera is for guiding during deployment and positioning. The ROV is equipped with spacer poles to maintain a constant distance between ROV with onboard optical sensors and bottom of the ice. All pre-tests of housing, thrusters, optical positioning, and ROV maneuverability were carried out in freshwater basins prior to field trials and tests. These were conducted at Kangerlussuaq, West Greenland on landfast first-year 79\textendash 80 cm thick ice with a variable (1\textendash 12 cm) snow cover in March 2016. The ROV was easily deployed through a hole (75 \texttimes{} 50 cm) in the ice and easy to maneuver below the ice. Test of positioning system showed an average deviation of 28 {$\pm$} 5 cm between optically based position and actual position with an average offset from center line of 16 {$\pm$} 5 cm. The ROV was applied for measuring the under-ice irradiance field and results demonstrated a solid negative correlation between snow depth and PAR transmittance. We derived a Normalized Differences Index (NDI) for snow depths: NDIsnow depth = [E(610 nm) \textendash{} E(490 nm)]/[E(610 nm) + E(490 nm)] with minimum attenuation at 490 nm and maximum at 610 nm. It is discussed that the correlations for both PAR transmittance and the NDI with snow depths are due to a combination of a constant distance between optical sensor and ice bottom, and accurate positioning. A test showed that the wakes of thrusters removed parts of the ice algae biomass, but the study demonstrates the applicability of this ROV design for measurements of the under-ice irradiance field below landfast sea ice with a new optical based positioning system.},

At each station, the backscattering coefficients and the field spectra were measured in situ, respectively, with a HS-6 and a FieldSpec 931 spectroradiometer (ASD Inc.). Almost concurrently, water samples were fetched with Niskin water-fetching equipment and then returned to the laboratory for concentration and absorption measurement. The whole lake was divided into different areas according to some indexes. Three models were used to calculate remote sensing reflectance R-rsc for the waters where the in situ remote sensing reflectance R-rsm was beyond the bottom effect, which was considered as optically deep waters. By comparison of R-rsc and R-rsm, the best model suitable for optically deep waters in Taihu Lake, together with its optimal experiential parameter, were selected and developed, which was very important and helpful to develop a universal model to estimate accurately remote sensing reflectance for the whole lake in the next step.},

During the rainy season of 2017, higher REE concentrations were found at the stations in the estuary ({$\Sigma$}REE = 0.06\textendash 0.42 {$\mu$}g L-1) than those at the river mouths (referred to as `outlet' stations, {$\Sigma$}REE = 0.001\textendash 0.14 {$\mu$}g L-1). However, the reverse occurred in the dry season of 2016 ({$\Sigma$}REE = 0.07\textendash 0.16 {$\mu$}g L-1 in the mid-estuary vs. 0.001\textendash 0.02 {$\mu$}g L-1in the outlet stations). Elevated concentrations of Pr, Nd, Dy and Ho, relative to the other REEs were found in water in both seasons at most sampling locations. However, in some estuary stations, no anomalies were detected in the SP or in the oysters while some anomalies were seen in SP from the outlet stations. Significant correlations between REE concentrations in SP and oysters as well as between both total REE concentrations and the La/Yb ratio (reflecting enhanced accumulation of light REEs (LREEs)) in oysters indicate that, in the Pearl River Estuary, the dominant REE uptake pathway in oysters is from particles. The elevated concentrations of Pr, Nd, Dy and Ho, which are reported here for the first time suggest that elevated levels of these elements may result from REE recycling and other industrialized activities in this area of southern China. Specific REEs could be used to indicate emerging contamination by the modern REE industry; furthermore, REE anomalies and patterns may be suitable tools to track REE sources. Elevated concentrations of Pr, Nd, Dy and Ho, relative to other REEs, were observed for the first time in the surface water of the Pearl River Delta and the REE uptake pathway in oysters was assessed.},

In the present study, we evaluated the importance of local (Danish) versus external (Baltic Sea\textendash North Sea) nutrient loads for surface Chl a-concentrations, total areal primary production and the vertical distributions of primary production in the W. Baltic Sea using the 3D coupled HBM-ERGOM model. This was assessed by improving descriptions of nutrient loads and primary production in the model and by conducting scenarios of different nutrient loads according to (i) the eutrophication level in 1990, (ii) the new Danish Water Plan (DWP) and iii) DWP+ the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP2). The model results showed that local nutrient reductions have a profound effect on Chl a concentrations and primary production in the coastal areas of the Western Kattegat and the Belt Sea with the highest impact {$<$}10\textendash 25km from the coast. However, on average for the study area, Danish reductions have a limited effect. The DWP complemented the BSAP2 reductions spatially, since they had the highest impact in different areas and both were important for improving the ecological status of the ecosystem. The model suggested a significant change in the vertical distribution of primary production with less deep primary production in response to increased nutrient load. We recommend using this redistribution as an ecological indicator of eutrophication in seasonally stratified seas. The new description of primary production takes into account that carbon fixation continue, even when phytoplankton is severely nutrient limited. This model improvement increases primary production by a factor of 2.6 and brings the model estimates in agreement with measurements and the physiology of phytoplankton. We recommend that other dynamic ecosystem models using Liebig's law for primary production consider a similar approach.},

Fifty-four aqueous samples from 11 different geographic locations and two plant extracts were analyzed untreated and after chemical treatments or irradiation were used in attempts to change the redox status of the natural organic matter. The EEMS spectra were generated and modeled using a PARAFAC package developed by Cory and McKnight (2005). The PARAFAC model output was examined for consistency with previously reported relations and with changes expected to occur upon experimental oxidation and reduction of aqueous samples. Results indicate the implied fraction of total sample fluorescence attributed to quinone-like moieties was consistent (0.64 to 0.78) and greater than that observed by Cory and McKnight (2005). The fraction of the quinone-like moieties that was reduced (the reducing index, RI) showed relatively little variation (0.46 to 0.71) despite attempts to alter the redox status of the natural organic matter. The RI changed little after reducing samples using zinc metal, oxidizing at high pH with air, or irradiating with a Xenon lamp. Our results, however, are consistent with the correlations between the fluorescence indices (FI) of samples and the ratio of PARAFAC fitting parameters suggested by Cory and McKnight (2005), though we used samples with a much narrower range of FI values.},

Two of the methods (PiF and RCS) were relative approaches; COST is an absolute image-based method and 6S, an absolute modeling method. The methods were applied to the hazy bands 1 through 4 of a Landsat TM scene of the year 1997, which was being used in a change detection project. The effects of corrections were studied in woodland patches. Three criteria, namely (a) image attributes; (b) image classification results, and (c) landscape metrics, were used for comparing the performance of the correction methods. Average pixel values, dynamic range, and coefficient of variation of bands constituted the first criterion, the area of detected vegetation through image classification was the second criterion, and patch and landscape measures of vegetation the third criterion. Overall, the COST, RCS, and 6S methods performed better than PiF and showed more stable results. The 6S method produced some negative values in bands 2 through 4 due to the unavailability of some data needed in the model. Having to use only a single set of image pixels for normalization in the PiF method and the difficulty of selecting such samples in the study area may be the reasons for its poor performance.},

However, sources of semi-labile DOC in lakes remain unclear. This study used a carbon stable isotope approach to examine relative contributions of autochthonous and allochthonous sources to semi-labile DOC. Vertical and seasonal variations in the concentration and carbon stable isotope ratio (delta(13)C) of DOC were determined in large (surface area 674 km(2); maximum depth 104 m), monomictic Lake Biwa. A sharp vertical gradient of delta(13)C of DOC (delta(13)C-DOC) during the stratification period [mean +/- A standard error (SE) -25.5 +/- A 0.1 and -26.0 +/- A 0.0aEuro degrees in the epi- and hypolimnion, respectively] indicated the accumulation of (13)C-rich DOC in the epilimnion. Vertical mixing explained the intermediate values of delta(13)C-DOC (-25.7 +/- A 0.0aEuro degrees) measured throughout the water column during the overturn period. Both DOC concentration and delta(13)C-DOC decreased in the hypolimnion during stratification, indicating selective remineralization of (13)C-rich DOC. Using a two-component mixing model, we estimated the delta(13)C value of semi-labile DOC to be -22.2 +/- A 0.3aEuro degrees, which was close to the delta(13)C of particulate organic carbon collected in the epilimnion during productive seasons (-22.7 +/- A 0.7aEuro degrees) but much higher than the delta(13)C-DOC in river waters (-26.5 +/- A 0.1aEuro degrees). Semi-labile DOC appeared to be mainly autochthonous in origin, produced by planktonic communities during productive seasons. The spatiotemporal uncoupling between production and remineralization of semi-labile DOC implies that hypolimnetic oxygen consumption may be affected by pelagic primary production during productive seasons of the preceding year.},

We examined the effects of addition of the surfactant Pluronic F68 to glutaraldehyde-fixed photosynthetic organisms in cultures and natural samples. In particular, we examined cell losses and modifications of side scatter (a proxy of cell size) and fluorescence of natural pigments. We found that different marine phytoplankton species react differently to the action of Pluronic F68. In particular, photosynthetic prokaryotes are less sensitive than eukaryotes. Observed cell losses may result from cell lysis or from cell adhesion to the walls of plastic tubes that are commonly used for flow cytometry analysis. The addition of the surfactant, Pluronic F68, has a positive effect on cells for long-term storage. We recommend to modify current protocols for preservation of natural marine planktonic samples, by fixing them with glutaraldehyde 0.25\% (final concentration) and adding Pluronic F68 at a final concentration of 0.01\% in the samples before preservation. Pluronic F68 also appears effective for preserving samples without fixation for subsequent sorting, e.g. for molecular biology analyses. (c) 2014 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

These I(c)-values corresponded to those estimated by a physiological model including light absorption and quantum yield for growth to describe carbon gain, and weight specific dark respiration, dark loss rate and thallus specific carbon (mol C m-2 thallus) to describe carbon loss. Absorption and quantum yield were close to the theoretical maximum for all species and could not explain differences in I(c). Respiration and thallus specific carbon varied more than 15-fold and were the main factors responsible for variations in I(c). Experimental I(c)-values correspond to 0.12 to 0.61 \% of the yearly surface light dose in Denmark (56-degrees-N). These values agree with the \% of surface light (\%SI) available at the depth limits of leathery and foliose macroalgae at different latitudes. Hence, there is no surplus of energy to balance grazing and mechanical losses, and these factors must be of minor importance for macroalgae growing at great depths. A literature review of depth limits for marine macroalgae reveals an upper zone of mainly leathery algae with depth limits of about 0.5 \% SI, an intermediate zone of foliose and delicate algae with depth limits at about 0.10 \% SI, and a lower zone of encrusted algae extending down to about 0.01 \% SI. This zonation pattern is accompanied by a decrease in thallus specific carbon (i.e. thinner thalli) with increasing depth. The inverse relationship between growth rate at low light and thallus specific carbon suggests that a thin thallus is essential for growth and survival of marine macroalgae at great depths.}

This may be the result of more severe nutrient stress in high-latitude lakes relative to polar marine environments and to the persistence of nonactive pigments in cold freshwaters.},

  abstract = {The spectral pattern of light attenuation in the ultraviolet (UV) and blue region (360-500 nm) was analyzed for seven high Arctic lakes. The best description of K-d versus wavelength was obtained with an exponential model similar to the model used for absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic compounds (CDOM), but with an additional parameter (K-back) that accounts for background scattering: K-d(lambda) = K-d(lambda(0))e(S(lambda 0-lambda)) + K-back, where K-d(lambda) is the diffuse vertical attenuation coefficient at wavelength lambda and S is the exponential slope parameter that characterizes the decrease in attenuation with increasing wavelength. The inclusion of the background parameter gave a significantly better fit and eliminated the systematic deviations over the spectrum that occur in the absence of K-back. The resultant S values (mean = 17.4 mu m(-1)) were on average 47\% higher than values calculated without a background parameter, and were more sensitive to between-lake differences. The same pattern was found when S was estimated from spectral K-d values in three literature data sets, so the new equation will generally increase the estimated values of S based on K-d and provide a more accurate guide to intersystem variability. A compilation of literature data for S (based on K-d and the new equation or on absorbance) showed that its mean value (+/-SE) is significantly higher in freshwaters (17.1 +/- 0.7 mu m(-1)) than in the sea (14.0 +/- 0.4 mu m(-1)). The variability in S was highest for low values of K-d or a (340 nm values below 3 m(-1)). This pattern may be due to instrument-related problems or more likely represents the real variability in the optical properties of CDOM in low colored systems. The analysis showed that S can vary significantly between and within systems (overall range = 9.2-36.2 mu m(-1)) and that the value obtained also depends on the method of calculation, the wavelength range, and the type of optical measurement.},

  abstract = {This study presents the results of a year-long study investigating the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Danish estuary, Horsens Fjord. The estuary is shallow with a mean depth of 2.9 m and receives high loadings of inorganic nutrients from its catchment. The behaviour of different DOM parameters i.e. dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorous (DOP), light absorption and eight fluorescence components, were analysed relative to conservative mixing. Many of the parameters did not behave conservatively. For DON, DOP and absorption, more than 65\% of the freshwater concentration was removed initially at salinities below 12. At higher salinities two general patterns were identified. Concentrations of DON, DOP and four humic fluorescent fractions were not, or only weakly, related to salinity, showing that other processes than mixing were involved. Other parameters such as DOC and two terrestrial humic components behaved conservatively. The same was true for DON during winter. These results are consistent with the finding that autochthonous DOM was the dominant source of DOM in this estuary. The molar C:N and C:P ratios for DOM (DOC:DON and DOC:DOP) in freshwater were 11 and 758, respectively. The DOC:DON ratio increased in the estuary during the productive season to average values between 13 and 17, due to accumulation of DOC and removal of DON. The DOC:DOP ratio decreased within the estuary showing that in general DOM was enriched with phosphorous, however, during the spring, when phosphorous was limiting, the DOC:DOP ratio increased due to low DOP concentrations. We hypothesise that in estuaries with high loadings of inorganic nutrients relative to DOM, production and degradation of DOM within the estuary will dominate over allochthonous inputs and control both concentration and characteristics of DOM. A conceptual model for this hypothesis is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Due to their shallowness, the littoral zone of these lakes occupies a large proportion of their surface and is extensively covered by macrophytes that are known to affect their physical, chemical and biological environments in various ways. This study documents the small-scale (5 km) bio-optical variations associated with the longitudinal passage of a water mass through macrophyte beds during their maximal growth season. The utilization of a 2D hydrodynamic model allowed us to establish hydrological connectivity between stations within the beds, and thus to identify longitudinal heterogeneity along the macrophyte beds. Significant changes in the inherent properties of the water were observed along the upstream-downstream gradient. Due to their effects on hydrodynamics, macrophytes were responsible for a decrease in particles and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) resulting in an increasing penetration depth of ultraviolet (UV) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Along the transect, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) decreased more rapidly than DOC resulting in a decrease of the CDOM to DOC ratio. The observed changes in the DOC pool may be explained by the constant input of non-chromophoric DOC from macrophyte leachates and exudation within the bed and/or the photochemical and microbial degradation of CDOM. The implication of such small-scale heterogeneity on Lake Saint-Pierre productivity is discussed.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive investigations of the Canadian Arctic during late summer and early fall revealed the widespread occurrence of long-lived subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCM) in seasonally ice-free waters. The vertical position of the SCM corresponded with the depth of the subsurface biomass maximum (SBM), at least in Baffin Bay, suggesting that SCM could be an important source of carbon for the food web. Most of these SCM were located well below the pycnocline in close association with the nitracline, implying that their vertical position was driven mainly by a shortage of inorganic nitrogen in the upper euphotic zone. The diversity of SCM configurations with respect to physical properties of the water column complicates the estimation of euphotic-zone chlorophyll and primary production from surface properties. High photosynthetic yields (Fv/Fm) showed the phytoplankton to be photosynthetically competent and well acclimated to conditions of irradiance and nutrient supply near the surface and at the SCM. A well-defined primary nitrite maximum was associated with the SCM in the southwest Canadian Arctic, but not in the northeast where nitrite concentrations were highest much below the euphotic zone. This contrast is consistent with differences in vertical stratification, the light \textendash dark cycle and, possibly, the physiological state and taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton community at the SCM. This study demonstrates that the SCM, once regarded as anecdotal due to under-sampling, are a dominant feature of the Arctic Ocean that should be considered in remote sensing studies and biogeochemical models.},

  abstract = {Large rivers are generally heterogeneous and productive systems that receive important inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial and in situ sources. Thus, they are likely to play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of the DOM flowing to the oceans. The asymmetric spatial gradient driven by directional flow and environmental heterogeneity contributes to the fate of DOM flowing downstream. Yet, the relative effects of spatial connectivity and environmental heterogeneity on DOM dynamics are poorly understood. For example, since environmental variables show spatial heterogeneity, the variation explained by environmental and spatial variables may be redundant. We used the St. Lawrence River (SLR) as a representative large river to resolve the unique influences of environmental heterogeneity and spatial connectivity on DOM dynamics. We used three-dimensional fluorescence matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to characterize the DOM pool in the SLR. Seven fluorophores were modeled, of which two were identified to be of terrestrial origin and three from algal exudates. We measured a set of environmental variables that are known to drive the fate of DOM in aquatic systems. Additionally, we used asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) modeling to take spatial connectivity into account. The combination of spatial and environmental models explained 85\% of the DOM variation. We show that spatial connectivity is an important driver of DOM dynamics, as a large fraction of environmental heterogeneity was attributable to the asymmetric spatial gradient. Along the longitudinal axis, we noted a rapid increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mostly controlled by terrestrial input of DOM originating from the tributaries. Variance partitioning demonstrated that freshly produced protein-like DOM was found to be the preferential substrate for heterotrophic bacteria undergoing rapid proliferation, while humic-like DOM was more correlated to the diffuse attenuation coefficient of UVA radiation.},

We used fish community data ({$>$}200 species) from extensive surveys conducted in two biogeographic provinces (extent {$>$}1,000 km) in North America to quantify the relationship between fish species richness and local (grain {$<$}10 km\textbackslash textsuperscript\{2\}) environmental heterogeneity. Our analyses are based on samples collected at nearly 800 stations over a period of five years. We demonstrate that fish species richness in coastal ecosystems is associated locally with the spatial heterogeneity of environmental variables but not with their magnitude. The observed effect of heterogeneity on species richness was substantially greater than that generated by simulations from a random placement model of community assembly, indicating that the observed relationship is unlikely to arise from veil or sampling effects. Our results suggest that restoring or actively protecting areas of high habitat heterogeneity may be of great importance for slowing current trends of decreasing biodiversity in coastal ecosystems.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Aquatic vegetation (AV) is an important component of aquatic system, affecting habitat carrying capacity and fish productivity. By modulating habitat complexity, AV has the potential to influence the early ontogenetic stages of many fish species. However, understanding how variations in AV abundance influence fish distribution and abundance at the landscape scale of freshwater ecosystems is a considerable challenge due to the difficulty of collecting the high-resolution data needed for such analyses. We used yellow perch (Perca flavescens) as a biological model to test the hypothesis that larval fish abundance is positively related to a AV-rich landscape. Combining seven years of extensive larval sampling and satellite imagery, our results suggest that fish larvae tend to be associated with AV habitats after hatching. Based on zero-inflated binomial models, the probability of observing perch larvae increased from approximately 20\% in low AV habitats to nearly 100\% in dense AV habitats (pseudo-R2=0.54). Our results also show that the probability of observing yellow perch larvae was lower during years of low water level and low AV biomass, likely limiting the availability of proper spawning or nursery habitats for fish. Furthermore, we demonstrate that larvae use both new AV as well as vegetative debris from the previous year that persisted through the winter. In agreement with a growing literature, our study gives additional support to the idea that AV plays a key role in freshwater fish recruitment.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier B.V. Based on an extensive literature survey containing more than 12,000 paired measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and absorption of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) distributed over four continents and seven oceans, we described the global distribution and transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along the aquatic continuum across rivers and lakes to oceans. A strong log-linear relationship (R 2 = 0.92) between DOC concentration and CDOM absorption at 350 nm was observed at a global scale, but was found to be ecosystem-dependent at local and regional scales. Our results reveal that as DOM is transported towards the oceans, the robustness of the observed relation decreases rapidly (R 2 from 0.94 to 0.44) indicating a gradual decoupling between DOC and CDOM. This likely reflects the decreased connectivity between the landscape and DOM along the aquatic continuum. To support this hypothesis, we used the DOC-specific UV absorbance (SUVA) to characterize the reactivity of the DOM pool which decreased from 4.9 to 1.7 m 2 \texttimes{} gC -1 along the aquatic continuum. Across the continuum, a piecewise linear regression showed that the observed decrease of SUVA occurred more rapidly in freshwater ecosystems compared to marine water ecosystems, suggesting that the different degradation processes act preferentially on CDOM rather than carbon content. The observed change in the DOM characteristics along the aquatic continuum also suggests that the terrestrial DOM pool is gradually becoming less reactive, which has profound consequences on cycling of organic carbon in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier B.V. Fine submicron organic particles can represent an important fraction of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool in aquatic ecosystems and their optical properties differ from those normally considered dissolved ( {$<$} . 0.2. {$\mu$}m), which means that the choice of filter type/pore size can influence the light absorption characteristics. In this study, a total of 867 paired CDOM absorption spectra (n = 1734) from different ecosystems (lakes, streams, sewages and estuaries) were measured on 0.2. {$\mu$}m and GF/F (nominal pore size 0.7. {$\mu$}m) filters. The aims were to evaluate how fine organic particles influence the spectral signature of the DOM pool and to quantify the effects of choice of filter type. In aquatic ecosystems influenced by terrestrial DOM (rivers and lakes), the dissolved fraction (here defined as {$<$} . 0.2. {$\mu$}m) overwhelmed the fine particulate signal (0.2-0.7. {$\mu$}m) which did not contribute significantly to the absorption signal. In contrast, freshly-produced fine particles released by phytoplankton significantly increased measured CDOM absorption in productive environments with low terrestrial background. Our results demonstrate that the choice of filter pore size can have a significant impact on the outcome of spectral metrics often used to characterise CDOM such as the spectral slope (S) or the slope ratio (SR). Hence, this may complicate the combining of CDOM absorption measurements from different studies where different pore sizes were used as fine particulate material may significantly influence the spectral signature, particularly in situations where phytoplankton is the dominating source of DOM.},

  abstract = {The vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient for downward plane irradiance ( K d ) is an apparent optical property commonly used in primary production models to propagate incident solar radiation in the water column. In open water, estimating K d is relatively straightforward when a vertical profile of measurements of downward irradiance, E d , is available. In the Arctic, the ice pack is characterized by a complex mosaic composed of sea ice with snow, ridges, melt ponds, and leads. Due to the resulting spatially heterogeneous light field in the top meters of the water column, it is difficult to measure at single-point locations meaningful K d values that allow predicting average irradiance at any depth. The main objective of this work is to propose a new method to estimate average irradiance over large spatially heterogeneous area as it would be seen by drifting phytoplankton. Using both in situ data and 3D Monte Carlo numerical simulations of radiative transfer, we show that (1) the large-area average vertical profile of downward irradiance, E d \textasciimacron{} ( z ) , under heterogeneous sea ice cover can be represented by a single-term exponential function and (2) the vertical attenuation coefficient for upward radiance ( K L u ), which is up to two times less influenced by a heterogeneous incident light field than K d in the vicinity of a melt pond, can be used as a proxy to estimate E d \textasciimacron{} ( z ) in the water column.},

The Green Edge initiative was developed to investigate the processes controlling the primary productivity and fate of organic matter produced during the Arctic phytoplankton spring bloom (PSB) and to determine its role in the ecosystem. Two field campaigns were conducted in 2015 and 2016 at an ice camp located on landfast sea ice southeast of Qikiqtarjuaq Island in Baffin Bay (67.4797{$\circ$} N, 63.7895{$\circ$} W). During both expeditions, a large suite of physical, chemical and biological variables was measured beneath a consolidated sea-ice cover from the surface to the bottom (at 360 m depth) to better understand the factors driving the PSB. Key variables, such as conservative temperature, absolute salinity, radiance, irradiance, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll a concentration, bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and taxonomy, and carbon stocks and fluxes were routinely measured at the ice camp. Meteorological and snow-relevant variables were also monitored.

  abstract = {Coastal Surveillance Through Observation of Ocean Color (COASTlOOC) oceanographic expeditions were conducted in 1997 and 1998 to examine the relationship between the optical properties of seawater and related biological and chemical properties across the coastal-to-open ocean gradient along the European coasts. A total of 379 stations were visited along the coasts of the Gulf of Lion in the Mediterranean Sea (n = 61), Adriatic Sea (n = 39), Baltic Sea (n = 57), North Sea (n = 99), English Channel (n = 85) and Atlantic Ocean (n = 38). A particular emphasis has been dedicated to the collection of a comprehensive set of apparent (AOPs) and inherent (IOPs) optical properties to support the development of ocean color remote sensing algorithms. The data were collected in situ using traditional ship-based sampling, but also from a helicopter, which is a very efficient means for that type of coastal sampling. The dataset collected during the COASTlOOC campaigns is still today quite unique in that it is fully consistent in terms of operators, protocols, and instrumentation. This rich and historical dataset is still today frequently requested and used by other researchers. Therefore, we present the result of an effort to compile and standardize a dataset which will facilitate their reuse in future development and evaluation of new bio-optical models adapted for optically-complex waters.},

Among-lake differences were the greatest source of variation of zooplanklon biomass, whereas the strong lake by-stratum interaction observed indicated that the vertical variations of zooplankton biomass and its size fractions were not constant from lake to lake. ne analysis of spatial and local factors based on thermal strata is consistent with conceptual models of predation and nutrient control on the biomass and size structure of the zooplankton. Productivity of the aquatic systems, which was driven by lake depth, flushing rate and total phosphorus concentration, was the primary actor influencing total Zooplankton biomass and size structure at among-lake scale in epilimnetic waters. The effects of the planktivorous fish on the large zooplankton biomass ({$>$}500 mum) was more clearly perceived when the effect of lake depth was removed by partial redundancy analysis. This study showed that although bottom-up and top-down forces are complementary in structuring of zooplankton communities, they can also act differently on the community attributes (e.g. biomass and size structure). Among-lake zooplanklon biomass is predictable from take trophy, but the size structure and vertical distribution of zooplankton communities appear to be controlled by lake stratification and by inference to interactions with size selective predation by fish. In metalimnetic waters, the 53-100 and 100-202 mum Zooplankton biomass fractions were primarily dependent on a biotic factors, while the 202-500 and {$>$}500 mum fractions were related to planktivory and picophytoplankton concentrations. The well-oxygenated and cold hypolimnetic waters of some lakes offered a refuge from surface turbulence and planktivory to large zooplankton size fractions (202 500 and {$>$}500 mum).},

  abstract = {The spatial and seasonal magnitude and variability of primary production in the Arctic Ocean (AO) is quantified with a pan-arctic approach. We synthesize estimates of primary production (PP), focusing on surface waters (0\textendash 5m), using complementary methods that emphasize different spatial and temporal scales. These methods include (1) in situ observations of 14C uptake mostly and possibly some O2 production reported in units of carbon (in situ PP), (2) remotely sensed primary production (sat-PP), and (3) an empirical algorithm giving net PP as a function of in situ chlorophyll a (in situ Chl-PP). The work presented herein examines historical data for PP collected in surface waters only, as they form the majority of the values of a larger ensemble of PP data collected over {$>$}50years (ARCSS-PP) by many national and international efforts. This extended set of surface and vertically-resolved data will provide pan-Arctic validation of remotely sensed chlorophyll a and PP, an extremely valuable tool in this environment which is so difficult to sample. To this day, PP data in the AO are scarce and have uneven temporal and spatial coverage which, when added to the AO's regional heterogeneity, its strong seasonal changes, and limited access, have made and continue to make obtaining a comprehensive picture of PP in the AO difficult. Daily surface in situ PP averaged 70 and 21mgCm-3d-1 for spring and summer, respectively, for the ca. 50year period across the AO. Average daily estimates of in situ PP in surface waters on a pan-Arctic basis were several fold higher with respect to remotely sensed PP (sat-PP) and in situ chlorophyll-derived PP (Chl-PP) in the spring period, likely due to differences in data availability and coverage. Summer daily averages for surface in situ PP and sat-PP were similar and twice as high as in situ Chl-PP. Differences among annual estimates of surface in situ PP, in situ Chl-PP and sat-PP across the Arctic Ocean are presented and discussed. The mode of all three differences was 0mg Cm-3y-1 and the median difference was within {$\pm$}400mgCm-3y-1. Agreement between annual surface sat-PP and in situ PP was within {$\pm$}1000mgCm-3y-1 for half of the data. We hope that the entire ARCSS-PP data set, especially if combined with any archiving by the latest IPY effort, will be employed to develop an improved, panarctic-specific PP remote sensing algorithm and to test hypotheses regarding the controls of PP in the AO. Furthermore, the ARCSS-PP is openly available to be used by AO modelers to calibrate, assimilate, validate and compare community ecosystem and biogeochemical numerical models and, when combined with field work, will allow for improved understanding, detection and prediction of long-term biological patterns.}

Light absorption by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) [aCDOM({$\lambda$})] plays an important role in the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean, contributing to the recent decline in sea ice, as well as in biogeochemical processes. We investigated aCDOM({$\lambda$}) in the Southern Beaufort Sea where a significant amount of CDOM is delivered by the Mackenzie River. In the surface layer, aCDOM(440) showed a strong and negative correlation with salinity, indicating strong river influence and conservative transport in the river plume. Below the mixed layer, a weak but positive correlation between aCDOM(440) and salinity was observed above the upper halocline, resulting from the effect of removal of CDOM due to brine rejection and lateral intrusion of Pacific summer waters into these layers. In contrast, the relationship was negative in the upper and the lower haloclines, suggesting these waters originated from Arctic coastal waters. DOC concentrations in the surface layer were strongly correlated with aCDOM(440) (r2 = 0.97), suggesting that this value can be estimated in this area, using aCDOM(440) that is retrieved using satellite ocean color data. Implications for estimation of DOC concentrations in surface waters using ocean color remote sensing are discussed.},

  abstract = {A series of papers have suggested that freshwater discharge, including a large amount of dissolved organic matter (DOM), has increased since the middle of the 20th century. In this study, a semi-analytical algorithm for estimating light absorption coefficients of the colored fraction of DOM (CDOM) was developed for southern Beaufort Sea waters using remote sensing reflectance at six wavelengths in the visible spectral domain corresponding to MODIS ocean color sensor. This algorithm allows the separation of colored detrital matter (CDM) into CDOM and non-algal particles (NAP) through the determination of NAP absorption using an empirical relationship between NAP absorption and particle backscattering coefficients. Evaluation using independent datasets, which were not used for developing the algorithm, showed that CDOM absorption can be estimated accurately to within an uncertainty of 35\% and 50\% for oceanic and coastal waters, respectively. A previous paper (Matsuoka et al., 2012) showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were tightly correlated with CDOM absorption in our study area (ri2 Combining double low line 0.97). By combining the CDOM absorption algorithm together with the DOC versus CDOM relationship, it is now possible to estimate DOC concentrations in the near-surface layer of the southern Beaufort Sea using satellite ocean color data. DOC concentrations in the surface waters were estimated using MODIS ocean color data, and the estimates showed reasonable values compared to in situ measurements. We propose a routine and near real-time method for deriving DOC concentrations from space, which may open the way to an estimate of DOC budgets for Arctic coastal waters. \textcopyright{} 2012 Author(s).}

  abstract = {Abstract. In addition to scattering coefficients, the light absorption coefficients of particulate and dissolved materials are the main factors determining the light propagation of the visible part of the spectrum and are, thus, important for developing ocean color algorithms. While these absorption properties have recently been documented by a few studies for the Arctic Ocean (e.g., Matsuoka et al., 2007, 2011; Ben Mustapha et al., 2012), the data sets used in the literature were sparse and individually insufficient to draw a general view of the basin-wide spatial and temporal variations in absorption. To achieve such a task, we built a large absorption database of the Arctic Ocean by pooling the majority of published data sets and merging new data sets. Our results show that the total nonwater absorption coefficients measured in the eastern Arctic Ocean (EAO; Siberian side) are significantly higher than in the western Arctic Ocean (WAO; North American side). This higher absorption is explained by higher concentration of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in watersheds on the Siberian side, which contains a large amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compared to waters off North America. In contrast, the relationship between the phytoplankton absorption (a\&varphi;({$\lambda$})) and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration in the EAO was not significantly different from that in the WAO. Because our semianalytical CDOM absorption algorithm is based on chl a-specific a\&varphi;({$\lambda$}) values (Matsuoka et al., 2013), this result indirectly suggests that CDOM absorption can be appropriately derived not only for the WAO but also for the EAO using ocean color data. Based on statistics, derived CDOM absorption values were reasonable compared to in situ measurements. By combining this algorithm with empirical DOC versus CDOM relationships, a semianalytical algorithm for estimating DOC concentrations for river-influenced coastal waters of the Arctic Ocean is presented and applied to satellite ocean color data.},

The Siberian (or eastern) side of the AO is characterized by higher CDOM absorption values compared to the North American (or western) side. This is due to the difference in watersheds between the eastern and western sides of the AO and is consistent with an Arctic absorption database recently built by Matsuoka et al. (2014). A direct comparison between in situ and satellite data demonstrates that CDOM absorption is derived Arctic-wide from satellite ocean color data with an average uncertainty of 12\% (root mean square error of 0.3 m- 1) using our previously published algorithm. For river-influenced coastal waters, we found a single and highly significant relationship between concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CDOM absorption (r2 \textquestiondown{} 0.94) covering major Arctic river mouths. By applying this in situ relationship to satellite-derived CDOM absorption, DOC concentrations in the surface waters are estimated for river-influenced coastal waters with an average uncertainty of 28\%.

Spatial variability in ice surface characteristics, i.e., snow thickness or melt pond distributions, and subsequent impact on transmitted PAR makes estimating light-limited primary production difficult during this time of year. Added to this difficulty is the interpretation of data from various sensor types, including hyperspectral, multispectral, and PAR-band irradiance sensors, with either cosine-corrected (planar) or spherical (scalar) sensor heads. To quantify the impact of the heterogeneous radiation field under sea ice, spectral irradiance profiles were collected beneath landfast sea ice during the Green Edge ice-camp campaigns in May\textendash June 2015 and June\textendash July 2016. Differences between PAR measurements are described using the downwelling average cosine, {$\mu$} d , a measure of the degree of anisotropy of the downwelling underwater radiation field which, in practice, can be used to convert between downwelling scalar, E 0d , and planar, E d , irradiance. A significantly smaller {$\mu$} d (PAR) was measured prior to snow melt compared to after (0.6 vs. 0.7) when melt ponds covered the ice surface. The impact of the average cosine on primary production estimates, shown in the calculation of depth-integrated daily production, was 16\% larger under light-limiting conditions when E 0d was used instead of E d . Under light-saturating conditions, daily production was only 3\% larger. Conversion of underwater irradiance data also plays a role in the ratio of total quanta to total energy (E Q /E W , found to be 4.25), which reflects the spectral shape of the under-ice light field. We use these observations to provide factors for converting irradiance measurements between irradiance detector types and units as a function of surface type and depth under sea ice, towards improving primary production estimates.},

Kinetically, the aggregation of iron occurs with a rapid initial reaction, finished within a few minutes, followed by an extensive, slow second reaction, which lasts for several hours. Organic carbon aggregation, however, occurs primarily in the first reaction. The first reaction is perikinetic while the second reaction is observed to be either perikinetic or orthokinetic, depending on the pore size of the filter used to clarify the suspension. The second reaction involves aggregation of small filtrable colloids ({$<$}0.5 ??m) with larger aggregates formed in the first reaction, and follows pseudo-second order kinetics with respect to the filtrable iron concentration when finer filters ({$<$}0.5 ??m) are used for clarification. Little or no temperature dependence is evident for the first reaction extent, while increasing temperature strongly enhances the second reaction. An activation energy of 9-11 kcal??mole-1 for the second reaction is due to a combination of transport and charge repulsion terms. Field data show a correspondingly greater aggregation extent of iron with salinity in warmer months relative to colder months. ?? 1982.},

Molecular weight measurements made with a newer generation HPSEC column and PSS standards from more recent lots are roughly 200 to 400 Da lower than initial measurements made in the early 1990s. These updated numbers match DOM molecular weights measured by colligative methods and fall within a range of values calculated from hydroxyl radical kinetics. These changes suggest improved accuracy of HPSEC molecular weight measurements that we attribute to improved accuracy of PSS standards and changes in the column packing. We also isolated DOM from wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) using XAD-8, a cation exchange resin, and PPL, a styrene-divinylbenzene media, and observed little difference in molecular weight and specific UV absorbance at 280 nm (SUVA280) between the two solid phase extraction resins, suggesting they capture similar DOM moieties. PPR DOM also showed lower SUVA280 at similar weights compared to DOM isolates from a global range of environments, which we attribute to oxidized sulfur in PPR DOM that would increase molecular weight without affecting SUVA280.},

Comparison of these findings, however, has been hampered by differences in time periods and methods of analysis. Here we compare changes in discharge from different regions of the pan-arctic watershed using identical time periods and analytical methods. Discharge to the Arctic Ocean increased by 5.6 km3 /y/y during 1964-2000, the net result of a large increase from Eurasia moderated by a small decrease from North America. In contrast, discharge to Hudson/James/Ungava Bays decreased by 2.5 km3/y/y during 1964-2000. While this evaluation identifies an overall increase in discharge ({$\sim$}120 km3/y greater discharge at the end of the time period as compared to the beginning for Hudson/James/Unvaga Bays and the Arctic Ocean combined), the contrasting regional trends also highlight the need to understand the consequences of adding/removing freshwater from particular regions of the arctic and subarctic oceans.

Measurements of the aforementioned covariates and surface and transmitted spectral irradiance were collected on landfast first-year sea ice in the High Arctic near Resolute Passage, Canada, during the spring of 2011 and used as model input. The derived model explains 75\textendash 84.5\% of the variation in the observed spectral optical depth curves. No prior assumptions of snow/sea-ice optical properties are required in the application of this technique, as the model estimates the attenuation coefficients of each covariate using only the measurements mentioned above. The quality and simplicity of the model highlight the potential of functional data analysis to study the Arctic marine ecosystem.},

Unified theories have been important in physics including the unification of electricity and magnetism and the unification of the electromagnetic with the weak nuclear force. Surprisingly, ecology, specifically the subfields of biodiversity and macroecology, also possess not one but at least six unified theories. This is problematic as only one unified theory is desirable. Superficially, the six unified theories seem very different. However, I show that all six theories use the same three rules or assertions to describe a stochastic geometry of biodiversity. The three rules are: (1) intraspecifically individuals are clumped together; (2) interspecifically global or regional abundance varies according to a hollow curve distribution; and (3) interspecifically individuals are placed without regard to individuals of other species. These three rules appear sufficient to explain local species abundance distributions, species-area relationships, decay of similarity of distance and possibly other patterns of biodiversity. This provides a unification of the unified theories. I explore implications of this unified theory for future research.},

A number of links can be drawn between these patterns. In particular, I show that local communities can be seen as random samples of the regional pool, but only as a special form of sampling that is autocorrelated due to the spatial clumping of individuals within a species. I describe two distinct sets of mathematical machinery that can start with the regional species abundance distribution and then predict local species richness, local species abundance distributions, and {$\beta$}-diversity (in the form of species area relationships or decay of similarity with distance). I conclude by examining some of the implications of the fact that biodiversity patterns are linked by autocorrelated sampling.},

  abstract = {The recent warming in the Arctic is affecting a broad spectrum of physical, ecological, and human/cultural systems that may be irreversible on century time scales and have the potential to cause rapid changes in the earth system. The response of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to changes in climate is a major issue of global concern, yet there has not been a comprehensive review of the status of the contemporary carbon cycle of the Arctic and its response to climate change. This review is designed to clarify key uncertainties and vulnerabilities in the response of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to ongoing climatic change. While it is clear that there are substantial stocks of carbon in the Arctic, there are also significant uncertainties associated with the magnitude of organic matter stocks contained in permafrost and the storage of methane hydrates beneath both subterranean and submerged permafrost of the Arctic. In the context of the global carbon cycle, this review demonstrates that the Arctic plays an important role in the global dynamics of both CO 2 and CH4. Studies suggest that the Arctic has been a sink for atmospheric CO2 of between 0 and 0.8 Pg C/yr in recent decades, which is between 0\% and 25\% of the global net land/ocean flux during the 1990s. The Arctic is a substantial source of CH4 to the atmosphere (between 32 and 112 Tg CH4/yr), primarily because of the large area of wetlands throughout the region. Analyses to date indicate that the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the Arctic during the remainder of the 21st century is highly uncertain. To improve the capability to assess the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to projected climate change, we recommend that (1) integrated regional studies be conducted to link observations of carbon dynamics to the processes that are likely to influence those dynamics, and (2) the understanding gained from these integrated studies be incorporated into both uncoupled and fully coupled carbon-climate modeling efforts. \textcopyright{} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

All models simulating carbon represented soil with depth, a critical structural feature needed to represent the permafrost carbon-climate feedback, but that is not a universal feature of all climate models. Between 2010 and 2299, simulations indicated losses of permafrost between 3 and 5 million km2 for the RCP4.5 climate and between 6 and 16 million km2 for the RCP8.5 climate. For the RCP4.5 projection, cumulative change in soil carbon varied between 66-Pg C (1015-g carbon) loss to 70-Pg C gain. For the RCP8.5 projection, losses in soil carbon varied between 74 and 652 Pg C (mean loss, 341 Pg C). For the RCP4.5 projection, gains in vegetation carbon were largely responsible for the overall projected net gains in ecosystem carbon by 2299 (8- to 244-Pg C gains). In contrast, for the RCP8.5 projection, gains in vegetation carbon were not great enough to compensate for the losses of carbon projected by four of the five models; changes in ecosystem carbon ranged from a 641-Pg C loss to a 167-Pg C gain (mean, 208-Pg C loss). The models indicate that substantial net losses of ecosystem carbon would not occur until after 2100. This assessment suggests that effective mitigation efforts during the remainder of this century could attenuate the negative consequences of the permafrost carbon-climate feedback.},

So far, empirical studies have only allowed us to identify a few functional traits that are consistently associated with disturbance. To determine the trait variations associated with climate, disturbance history and current disturbance regime as well as the interactions between these factors, global-scale comparisons of numerous individual studies are required. Significant advances toward this ambitious goal are presented in these papers, and include: (1)the articulation of experimental and analytical methodologies for individual studies that could usefully contribute to a global comparison; (2) the identification of core traits that can be used in the further search for disturbance-related traits common to a range of environments; (3) further information on vegetation response to disturbance in terms of trait representation, and the identification of attribute syndromes; (4) the identification of issues for modelling disturbance dynamics using functional types.},

  abstract = {1. Structural complexity may stabilise predator\textendash prey interactions and affect the outcome of trophic cascades by providing prey refuges. In deep lakes, vulnerable zooplankton move vertically to avoid fish predation. In contrast, submerged plants often provide a diel refuge against fish predation for large-bodied zooplankton in shallow temperate lakes, with consequences for the whole ecosystem. 2. To test the extent to which macrophytes serve as refuges for zooplankton in temperate and subtropical lakes, we introduced artificial plant beds into the littoral area of five pairs of shallow lakes in Uruguay (30\textdegree\textendash 35\textdegree S) and Denmark (55\textdegree\textendash 57\textdegree N). We used plants of different architecture (submerged and free-floating) along a gradient of turbidity over which the lakes were paired. 3. We found remarkable differences in the structure (taxon-richness at the genus level, composition and density) of the zooplankton communities in the littoral area between climate zones. Richer communities of larger-bodied taxa (frequently including Daphnia spp.) occurred in the temperate lakes, whereas small-bodied taxa characterised the subtropical lakes. More genera and a higher density of benthic/plant-associated cladocerans also occurred in the temperate lakes. The density of all crustaceans, except calanoid copepods, was significantly higher in the temperate lakes (c. 5.5-fold higher). 4. Fish and shrimps (genus Palaemonetes) seemed to exert a stronger predation pressure on zooplankton in the plant beds in the subtropical lakes, while the pelagic invertebrate Chaoborus sp. was slightly more abundant than in the temperate lakes. In contrast, plant-associated predatory macroinvertebrates were eight times more abundant in the temperate than in the subtropical lakes. 5. The artificial submerged plants hosted significantly more cladocerans than the free-floating plants, which were particularly avoided in the subtropical lakes. Patterns indicating diel horizontal migration were frequently observed for both overall zooplankton density and individual taxa in the temperate, but not the subtropical, lakes. In contrast, patterns of diel vertical migration prevailed for both the overall zooplankton and for most individual taxa in the subtropics, irrespective of water turbidity. 6. Higher fish predation probably shapes the general structure and dynamics of cladoceran communities in the subtropical lakes. Our results support the hypothesis that horizontal migration is less prevalent in the subtropics than in temperate lakes, and that no predator-avoidance behaviour effectively counteracts predation pressure in the subtropics. Positive effects of aquatic plants on water transparency, via their acting as a refuge for zooplankton, may be generally weak or rare in warm lakes.},

Phytoplankton production of total organic carbon (P-TOC) was partitioned into production of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (P-DOC and P-POC, respectively), the latter being further partitioned into production of large and small phytoplankton (P-L and P-S, respectively) using 5 mum as threshold. The highest P-TOC was 6 g C m(-2) d(-1) at peak bloom. The fraction of P-DOC in P-TOC was lower in periods of high P-TOC than those of low P-TOC. Averaged over the whole polynya for the sampling period, P-DOC and P-POC accounted for 34 and 66\% of the fixed carbon, respectively, and 81 and 19\% of P-POC were in the P-L and P-S fractions, respectively. Variations in the integrated assimilation numbers of large and small phytoplankton were mostly explained by nutrients and irradiance. Even though P-POC was dominated by large phytoplankton, the sinking rates of the phytoplankton cells were relatively low (0 to 0.7 m d-1), hence low export of P-POC to depth (17\%), and relatively high potential transfer to large pelagic organisms through the herbivorous food web. This explains why the NOW is a major feeding and spawning area for fish, mammals and birds.},

Our analysis indicated differences between the C:vol relationships available for ciliates. A new C:vol relationship for diatoms was established (pgC cell-1 = 0.288 X volume0.811). Dinoflagellates are significantly more C dense than diatoms. Except for diatoms, we found few significant differences between C: vol relationships of different phylogenetic groups. Consequently, one C: vol relationship for taxonomically diverse protist plankton excluding diatoms was determined (pgC cell-1 = 0.216 x volume0.939). In the combined data set, carbon density was not constant but decreased significantly with increasing cell volume. Using constant C:vol conversion factors for plankton over large size ranges will cause systematic errors in biomass estimates.}

Large-scale variation in factors such as environmental stress, dispersal or productivity sets the stage for local-scale ecological processes such as predation or competition. Until recently, most research focused on local-scale explanations of community pattern. Current models attempt to integrate the role of individual large-scale factors with local-scale processes. This trend will continue, with increased effort to understand the specific means by which large-scale factors cause variation among communities.},

Since for future analyses of ice wedges, a higher sampling resolution with limited sample volume is required, the limit of the equilibration technique for small water sample sizes of between 0.05 and 5 ml was checked. For water samples smaller than 1 ml, corresponding to a molar ratio [H2O]/[H2] of smaller than 0.994, a balance correction has to be applied. The experimental errors due to partial evaporation during evacuation, the balance calculation of the isotope equilibrium process, the linearity as well as memory effects of the mass spectrometer for samples with large differences in {$\delta$}18O and {$\delta$}D are tackled in this paper. In the polar regions of Northern Siberia without Late Pleistocene and Holocene glaciation, ground ice is used as an archive for paleoclimate studies. First results of stable isotope measurements on ice wedges clearly show a shift towards heavier isotopes and thus warmer winter temperatures as well as a change in the source of the precipitation between Late Pleistocene and Holocene. These results indicate the high potential of ground ice for paleoclimate studies.},

Current observations for the upper {$\sim$}200m show mostly a barotropic flow, enhanced over the shallow Yermak Plateau. The two branches of inflowing Atlantic Water are partly captured, confirming that the outer Yermak Branch follows the perimeter of the plateau, and the inner Svalbard Branch the coast. Atlantic Water observed to be warmer and shallower than in the climatology, is found directly below the mixed layer down to 800m depth, and is warmest along the slope, while properties inside the basin are quite homogeneous. From late May onwards, the drift was continually close to the ice edge and a thinner surface mixed layer and shallower Atlantic Water coincided with significant sea ice melt being observed.

The macrophyte groups were bryophytes, charophytes, caulescent angiosperms, rosette-type angiosperms and Isoetes spp. 2. The data showed systematic differences among the groups in the relationship of Z(c) to water transparency. In lakes with low transparency (Secchi disc transparency (Z(s)) less than 7 m) caulescent angiosperms and charophytes penetrated deepest followed by bryophytes and Isoetes spp. In more transparent lakes bryophytes grew deepest, followed by charophytes, caulescent angiosperms and Isoetes spp. Rosette-type angiosperms had the lowest Z(c) in all types of lakes. Charophytes and caulescent angiosperms had similar depth limits in lakes with Z(s) {$<$} 4 m but charophytes grew deeper in more transparent lakes. The depth limits of both groups were independent of light penetration in lakes with very low transparency (Z(s) {$<$} 1 m). The annual light exposure for the deepest growing macrophytes (bryophytes) was 20-95 mol photons m(-2). 3. The relationship between Z(c), macrophyte type and lake transparency could be explained by three distinct processes regulating Z(c). In lakes with low transparency (Z(s) {$<$} 1 m), tall macrophytes (caulescent angiosperms and charophytes) compensate for light limitation by shoot growth towards the water surface and Z(c) is therefore independent of transparency. In lakes with medium transparency (1 m {$<$} Z(s) {$<$} 4 m) Z(c) for angiosperms, charophytes and Isoetes spp. is constrained by light attenuation in the water column, corresponding to a linear relationship between Z(c) and Z(s). This pattern also applies to bryophytes, despite lake transparency. In transparent lakes, the minimum light requirement at Z(c) increased with increasing transparency for angiosperms, charophytes and Isoetes spp. 4. The minimum light requirements among submersed macrophytes (including marine macroalgae) depend on their plant-specific carbon value (plant biomass per unit of light-absorbing surface area) for the species/group, indicating that the light requirements of submersed plants are tightly coupled to the plants' possibility to harvest light and hence to the growth form. 5. The light requirements increased on average 0.04\% surface irradiance per degree increase in latitude corresponding to an average decrease in Z(c) of 0.12 m per degree latitude.}

  abstract = {Quantum yield spectra for the photochemical formation of biologically labile photoproducts from dissolved organic matter (DOM) have not been available previously, although they Would greatly facilitate attempts to model photoproduct formation rates across latitudinal, seasonal, and depth-related changes in spectral irradiance. Apparent quantum yield spectra were calculated for two coastal environments from the southeastern United States using postirradiation bacterial respiration as a measure of total labile photoproduct formation and a cutoff filter method to model spectral dependence. As has been the case for previously studied classes of DOM photoproducts (i.e., dissolved inorganic carbon, CO, and H(2)O(2)), ultraviolet (UV)-B irradiance was significantly more efficient at forming labile photoproducts (i.e., compounds readily assimilated by marine bacterioplankton) than UV-A and visible irradiance. Calculations of DOM photoproduct formation in southeastern U.S. coastal surface waters indicate a formation ratio for biologically labile photoproducts: CO of 13:1. The slope of a natural log plot of the apparent quantum yield spectrum obtained for biologically labile photoproducts was similar to that for CO (0.028 nm (1) vs. 0.034 nm(-1)). Modeled kinetic rates therefore indicate that the production ratio of these photoproduct classes is approximately maintained despite variations in the solar spectrum that occur with depth in a water column or distance from shore. Application of the apparent quantum yield to coastal regions worldwide predicts an annual formation rate of biologically labile photoproducts in coastal waters of 206 x 10(12) g C.},

  abstract = {We investigated the transport and production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in an alpine lake in the Colorado Front Range during snowmelt and the summer ice-free season by employing a new approach for distinguishing between three pools of DOM based on fractionation and spectroscopic characterization. Reactive transport modeling results confirm that terrestrially derived sources of humic DOM are dominant during snowmelt and that microbially derived humic and nonhumic DOM are produced in the lake in the summer, when rates of primary productivity are highest. DOM characterization and modeling results support the interpretation that losses of terrestrially derived humic DOM are dependent on photochemistry and indicate that the decay of nonhumic and microbially derived humic DOM is more influenced by heterotrophic degradation. Results suggest that production of nonhumic DOM can be directly related to chlorophyll a concentrations and that microbially derived humic DOM can be produced through condensation reactions. Furthermore, fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of DOM suggest that the rate of decay of microbially derived humic DOM decreases as the redox state of quinone-like moieties of the DOM becomes more oxidized. This study quantifies the influence of DOM source on the chemical and biological reactivity of DOM in lakes. The methods presented in this study provide a framework for testing hypotheses related to the effects of a changing climate on lake ecosystem structure and function.},

Excitationemission matrices of whole water DOM and fulvic acid were analyzed by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Allochthonous inputs of terrestrially derived fulvic acid DOM were dominant during snowmelt at the alpine lake, and during both snowmelt and summer at the subalpine sites. At the alpine lake, autochthonous inputs of DOM dominated during the summer phytoplankton bloom, and the spectral characteristics of the whole water DOM diverged from those of the fulvic acid. For example, the quinonelike fluorophores in whole water DOM at the alpine lake were more oxidized and microbially derived than the fulvic acid fraction during the summer. At the subalpine sites, the seasonal changes in the source and redox state of the quinonelike fluorophores of the whole water DOM tracked those of the fulvic acid pool. However, at both lake sites there was a greater contribution of amino acidlike fluorophores in the whole water DOM than the fulvic acid fraction. This trend was not observed at the subalpine stream site. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the PARAFAC components suggests that during snowmelt, the chemical quality of the DOM at the alpine lake was similar to that of the subalpine stream; whereas the alpine site was more similar to the subalpine lake during the summer. Spectral characterization and PCA of the PARAFAC components suggest that nonhumic quinonelike and amino acidlike fluorophores were produced in the alpine lake during the summer phytoplankton bloom. Our results show that different types of water bodies produce different seasonal patterns in whole water DOM and fulvic acid quantity and quality.}

  abstract = {in order to examine dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluxes in seasonal wetland systems that expand and contract seasonally, a time-variable model of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was developed for a seasonal floodplain in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. The model simulates DOC concentrations from March 2001 to November 2002, during which time DOC concentrations varied between 8 and 31 mg C L-1. The model uses a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) approach to describe the hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on DOC leached from litter within the floodplain and transported into the floodplain from upstream. In 2002, a fire burned the floodplain and less litter was available for leaching than in 2001. The model was driven by observations of discharge, water temperature, upstream DOC concentrations, and DOC leaching rates from leaching experiments. Leaching experiments with sedges and grasses indicated that on average 23 mg DOC g(-1) were leached during the first day of wetting and 0.6 mg DOC g(-1) d(-1) were continuously leached afterwards. Leaching experiments also showed a decreased amount of DOC released from burned litter and soils than from unburned litter and soils. A two-pool first-order decay model that represents both rapidly (0.14 d(-1) (at 22 degrees C)) and slowly (0.045 d(-1)) decaying pools of DOC provided the best representation of observed patterns in DOC concentration in 2001. The decay rate of the first pool decreased by nearly half in 2002, when an estimated 78\% of litter was removed by fire. Upstream DOC transport into the floodplain was the dominant source of DOC (representing approximately 70\% and 75\% of the DOC input in 2001 and 2002, respectively), followed by DOC leaching from litter and DOC originating from microbial sources. In 2001, decomposition (representing approximately 36\% of the DOC loss), outflow to an adjacent floodplain (36\%) and infiltration (28\%) were the major removal mechanisms for DOM from the study floodplain. The large amount of DOC transported by infiltration implies storage of DOC in the subsurface, which may influence subsurface heterotrophic activity. In light of future climate change anticipated for the region, a scenario using a 2 degrees C increase in average water temperature and 10\% reduction in upstream DOC mass was performed and resulted in significant (11\%) reduction in annual DOC mass within the study floodplain.

Here, to assess this influence, we evaluate factors related to aerosol deposition, climate, catchment properties, and microbial constituents in a global dataset of 86 alpine and polar lakes. We show significant latitudinal trends in dissolved organic matter quantity and quality, and uncover new evidence that this geographic pattern is influenced by dust deposition, flux of incident ultraviolet radiation, and bacterial processing. Our results suggest that changes in land use and climate that result in increasing dust flux, ultraviolet radiation, and air temperature may act to shift the optical quality of dissolved organic matter in clear, alpine lakes.},

Results show that total luminescence spectra, represented as excitation-emission matrices (EEMs), may be used to discriminate between soil-derived and aquatic-derived IHSS humic substances and between humic and fulvic acids derived from the same source (soil or aquatic). Ionic strength in the range of 0-1 M KCl and humic substance concentration in the range of 5-100 mg/L had little effect on the fluorescence spectral characteristics of the humic substances, while pH had significant effects as expected. Absorbance correction was shown to be essential for accurate representation and comparison of the EEMs of the humic substances at high concentrations.},

Compared with existing approaches, this algorithm dramatically increases the speed and accuracy of biomass estimates from plankton images, and is thus especial- ly suited for use with automated cell imaging technologies that produce large quantities of data. The algorithm operates on a two-dimensional image processed to identify organism boundaries. First, the distance of each inte- rior pixel to the nearest boundary is calculated; next these same distances are assumed to apply for projection in the third dimension; and finally the resulting volume is adjusted by a multiplicative factor assuming locally circular cross-sections in the third dimension. Other cross-sectional shape factors can be applied as needed. In this way, the simple, computationally efficient, volume calculation can be refined to include taxon-specific shape information if available. We show that compared to traditional manual microscopic analysis, the distance map algorithm is unbiased and accurate (mean difference = \textendash 0.25\%, standard deviation = 17\%) for a range of cell morphologies, including those with concave boundaries that deviate from simple geometric shapes and whose volumes are not well represented by a solid of revolution around a single axis. Automated calculation of cell volumes can now be implemented with a combination of this new distance map algorithm for complex shapes and the solid of revolution approach for simple shapes, with an automated decision criterion to choose the}

  abstract = {1. Experimental studies have provided significant knowledge of how biodiversity can influence ecosystem processes. However, there is a growing need to relate these findings to natural communities. 2. Here we identify two major hypotheses for how communities may influence ecosystem processes: the 'diversity hypothesis' (the diversity of organisms in a community influences ecosystem processes through mechanisms such as complementary resource use), and the 'mass ratio hypothesis' (ecosystem processes are determined overwhelmingly by the functional traits of the dominant species). We then test which of these two hypotheses best explain variation in ecosystem properties and processes (biomass pools and fluxes, water use, light interception) in a temperate native grassland. We do this by applying various measures of diversity, functional diversity, and functional identity, whose significant relations with ecosystem processes would support either of the competing hypotheses. 3. Mean trait values best explained variation in five of the eight ecosystem processes examined, supporting Grime's mass ratio hypothesis, which proposes that the functional identities of the dominant species largely determine ecosystem processes. 4. Multi-trait functional diversity indices also explained large amounts of variation in ecosystem processes, while only weak relationships were observed between species richness and ecosystem processes. 5. To explore the mechanistic interactions between variables, we developed structural equation models (SEMs), which indicated that many of the community diversity and trait properties significantly influenced ecosystem processes, even after accounting for co-varying biotic/abiotic factors. 6. Synthesis. Our study is one of the first explicit comparisons of the 'diversity' and 'mass ratio' hypotheses, and our results most strongly support the mass ratio hypothesis, that is, the traits of the dominant species most influenced the ecosystem properties and processes examined. Our results suggest that the management of communities for the maintenance of ecosystem processes should focus on species dominance hierarchies.},

We compare three transport time scales (flushing time, age, and residence time) commonly used to measure the retention of water or scalar quantities transported with water. We identify the underlying assumptions associated with each time scale, describe procedures for computing these time scales in idealized cases, and identify pitfalls when real-world systems deviate from these idealizations. We then apply the time scale definitions to a shallow 378 ha tidal lake to illustrate how deviations between real water bodies and the idealized examples can result from: (1) non-steady flow; (2) spatial variability in bathymetry, circulation, and transport time scales; and (3) tides that introduce complexities not accounted for in the idealized cases. These examples illustrate that no single transport time scale is valid for all time periods, locations, and constituents, and no one time scale describes all transport processes. We encourage aquatic scientists to rigorously define the transport time scale when it is applied, identify the underlying assumptions in the application of that concept, and ask if those assumptions are valid in the application of that approach for computing transport time scales in real systems.},

These scenarios were based on the results,of several different general circulation models (GCMs). The direction of change in simulated vegetation patterns between different GCMs was found to be quite similar for all future projections. Although there were differences in magnitude and extent, all simulations indicate potential for enormous ecological change. The Kappa statistic proved to be a useful and straightforward measure of agreement between the different global vegetation maps. Furthermore, Kappa statistics for individual vegetation zones clearly indicated differences and similarities between those maps. The Kappa statistic was found to be most useful for rank ordering of agreement, both across a series of maps and across the various vegetation zones within a map.},

Some invoke anthropogenic forcing through mechanisms related to climate change, nitrogen deposition or changes in land use, and by implication suggest that current concentrations and fluxes are without precedent. All of these hypotheses imply that DOC levels will continue to rise, with unpredictable consequences for the global carbon cycle. Alternatively, it has been proposed that DOC concentrations are returning toward pre-industrial levels as a result of a gradual decline in the sulphate content of atmospheric deposition. Here we show, through the assessment of time series data from 522 remote lakes and streams in North America and northern Europe, that rising trends in DOC between 1990 and 2004 can be concisely explained by a simple model based solely on changes in deposition chemistry and catchment acid-sensitivity. We demonstrate that DOC concentrations have increased in proportion to the rates at which atmospherically deposited anthropogenic sulphur and sea salt have declined. We conclude that acid deposition to these ecosystems has been partially buffered by changes in organic acidity and that the rise in DOC is integral to recovery from acidification. Over recent decades, deposition-driven increases in organic matter solubility may have increased the export of DOC to the oceans, a potentially important component of regional carbon balances. The increase in DOC concentrations in these regions appears unrelated to other climatic factors.},

Signals from the detector are sent to a delayed coincidence circuit which discriminates decays of the 224Ra daughters, 220Rn and 216Po, from decays of the 223Ra daughters, 219Rn and 215Po. The system is calibrated using 232Th and 227Ac standards with daughters in equilibrium adsorbed on Mn fiber.

In this mixing zone, chemical reactions of the salty water with aquifer solids modify the composition of the water; much as riverine particles and suspended sediments modify the composition of surface estuarine waters. To emphasize the importance of mixing and chemical reaction in these coastal aquifers, I call them subterranean estuaries. Geochemical studies within subterranean estuaries have preceded studies that attempt to integrate the effect of these systems on the coastal ocean. The mixing zone between fresh ground water and sea water has long been recognized as an important site of carbonate diagenesis and possibly dolomite formation. Biologists have likewise recognized that terrestrial inputs of nutrients to the coastal ocean may occur through subterranean processes. Further evidence of the existence and importance of subterranean estuaries comes from the distribution of chemical tracers in the coastal ocean. These tracers originate within coastal aquifers through chemical reactions of the saline water with aquifer solids. They reach the coastal ocean as the surface and subterranean systems exchange fluids. Exchange between the subterranean estuary and the coastal ocean may be quantified by the tracer distribution in the coastal ocean. Examples from the east and Gulf coasts of the U.S., as well as the Bay of Bengal, will be used to evaluate the importance of these unseen estuaries in supplying not only chemical tracers, but also nutrients, to coastal waters. Anthropogenic effects on subterranean estuaries are causing significant change to these systems. Ground water mining, sea level rise, and channel dredging impact these systems directly. The effects of these changes are only beginning to be realized in this vital component of the coastal ecosystem.},

Our results suggest that marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence can be categorized into two distinct groups of fluorescing compounds. One group is distinguished by a protein-type fluorescence (excitation about 220 and 270 nm and emission about 300-350 nm) and the other group is characterized by a humic-type fluorescence (excitation about 230 and 310 nm and emission about 420-450 nm). Chemical evidence supports the interpretation that proteins and humic substances are mainly responsible for these two fluorescence types in seawater. At both the Atlantic and Pacific stations, protein-type fluorescence was dominant in the upper water column, while humic-type fluorescence was dominant in the deeper samples. These results suggest that fluorescence can be used to study the nature and distribution of two major DOM fractions, i.e. recent biochemical versus old humic substances, in the open ocean.

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents a discussion on photochemistry and the cycling of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and Phosphorus. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a dominant role in the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) and visible light in the open ocean. As \{DOM\} absorbance is regulated in part by photobleaching processes, light availability for photosynthesis and the penetration of \{UV\} radiation within the marine environment are influenced by photochemical transformations. In addition to its control on \{UV\} light fields, \{DOM\} photochemistry strongly impacts the biogeochemical cycling of biologically important elements in surface seawater. By the conversion of \{DOM\} into volatile species such as carbonyl sulfide, \{DOM\} photochemistry influences atmospheric chemistry and climate. The chapter illustrates an important light-driven chemical reaction in the photic zone\textemdash that is, the reduction of trace metals such as iron, manganese, and copper. The chemistry of these reduced species is quite different from their oxidized counterparts. Photochemical oxidation of \{DOM\} also produces a suite of free radicals and other short-lived species including the superoxide anion, carbonate radical, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, di-bromide radical anion, and a number of poorly described organic radicals and excited state triplets. These species are much more reactive than their corresponding diamagnetic and ground state species and are expected to influence biological and chemical processes in sunlit surface waters. Furthermore, \{DOM\} photolysis is an important source or sink of a variety of atmospherically important gases that are emitted from the ocean, some of which affect the Earth's radioactive balance. Concentrations\textemdash and hence emissions\textemdash of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbonyl sulfide (OCS), and di-methyl sulfide (DMS) are all partly regulated through photochemical processes involving DOM.},

All biologically labile photoproducts identified to date fall into one of four categories: (1) low-molecular-weight (MW) organic compounds (carbonyl compounds with MW of {$<$}200); (2) carbon gases (primarily CO); (3) unidentified bleached organic matter; and (4) nitrogen-and phosphorus-rich compounds (including NH4+ and PO43-). A number of laboratory studies using bacterial bioassay approaches have shown that the photochemical breakdown of DOM can stimulate biomass production or activity by 1.5- to 6-fold. Results of photochemical studies, extrapolated to estimate formation rates of biologically available photoproducts from DOM in surface waters, also predict important biological roles for these compounds. In a continental shelf system, for example, full exposure of surface seawater to sunlight for one summer day can produce DOM photodegradation products equivalent to {$>$}20\% of the bacterial carbon demand. Likewise, 30\% of the bacterial nitrogen demand can be met by photodegradation of the nitrogen components of DOM, a process likely to be of particular importance in nitrogen-limited systems. When considered on a depth-integrated basis around the globe, at least 1.0 x 1015 g C and 0.15 X 1015 g N are estimated to be available annually for utilization by planktonic microorganisms through the conversion of light-absorbing fractions of DOM to more biologically labile compounds. By comparison, direct photochemical mineralization of DOM is estimated to convert 12-16 x 1015 g C to CO2 annually.},

  abstract = {Recent studies by MOREL (1978) and PLATT, SATHYENDRANATH, CAVERHILL and LEWIS (1988) have demonstrated the relative stability of the relationship between available photosynthetic energy at the ocean surface and energy stored by algal photosynthesis, once it has been normalized with respect to the column integrated chlorophyll biomass. Therefore the cross section vis a vis photosynthesis and per unit of areal chlorophyll, phi*, in m2 (g Chl)-1, should be relatively stable in spite of the various environmental and trophic situations possibly encountered in the open ocean. Such an ecological or biogeochemical "constant" is of importance when trying to transform biomass maps (obtained from remotely sensed ocean colour data) into primary production maps. Its approximate constancy has to be understood and deserves analysis. This analysis rests on the use of the local and instantaneous growth rate equation (KIEFER and MITCHELL, 1983) which has to be triply integrated with respect to wavelength, depth and time. Such an integration is, in effect, the core of a light production model which schematically includes the following steps: (i) to compute as a function of the sun elevation for various days, latitudes and atmospheric conditions (aerosols, water vapour, etc.) the photosynthetic energy impinging at the ocean surface (direct and diffuse components); (ii) to account for the loss by reflection at the air-sea interface; (iii) to propagate this radiant energy (in terms of spectral scalar irradiance) throughout the water column and according to given pigment vertical profiles; (iv) to evaluate what part of energy is absorbed by algae within the productive column; (v) and finally to compute that part of absorbed energy which is stored in the form of organic carbon added to the initial biomass; this last step implies that the yield for growth be modelled as a function of the irradiance level and temperature. Sensitivity tests have been effected with respect not only to the physical parameters which can be accurately modelled, but also with respect to the physiological factors for which values and parameterisation are more uncertain. Non-linear and interactive influences cause the phi* values obtained by running the model, to vary within a rather restricted range (within a factor 2, for most of the trophic and environmental conditions), which are similar to those resulting from field studies. The variability of the biomass-normalized primary production can be explained and the seasonal or zonal trends illustrated. The effect of cloudiness is also analyzed. This spectral light - photosynthesis model (a sub model in the more general study of the biomass evolution) can be used either to reproduce primary production experiments and also as a predictive tool in the oceanic carbon fixation problem. The global scale made accessible by satellite techniques requires that a climatological field of the phi* parameter be produced. This can be done by operating the present model, provided that the physiological factors which intervene are sufficiently ascertained and adequately parameterised, and also provided that the vertical distribution of the algal biomass can be inferred from the partial information (restricted to the upper layer) delivered by ocean colour sensors.},

  abstract = {Use of ocean color satellite data in global biogeochemical studies requires models to predict primary production from the satellite-derived chlorophyll fields. In this paper, measured biooptical and photo-physiological data are used in place of standard (constant) parameters to adjust a previously published primary production model. In the JGOFS-France program, systematic studies were carried out at three locations in the tropical northeast Atlantic, selected to represent typical EUtrophic, MEsotrophic and oLIgotrophic regimes (EUMELI cruises). During cruise no. 4, these studies included the spectral measurements of the photosynthetically available radiation at sea level and within the water column, the determination of the algal absorption spectra and the determination of the physiological parameters derivable from P versus E experiments (photosynthesis irradiance responses). The model predictions are compared with in situ determinations made by the14C technique (JGOFS core parameter). At the three sites, the physical structure (mixed layer and euphotic depths), the algal abundance and community structure, as well as their bio-optical and physiological properties, are very different, so that the predictive performance of the model was tested in trophic conditions that span most of those expected in the global open ocean. The model, when adjusted by entering the actual physiological parameters (chlorophyll-specific absorption of algae, maximum quantum yield, and light saturated carbon fixation rate), provides satisfying results compared to those observed in situ. The relative roles of the physiological parameters are analyzed and sensitivity studies are performed. For global applications, and in the absence of specific information when all seasons and provinces of the world ocean are considered, it will remain necessary for a while to rely on generic models and a selected standard set of physiological properties The sensitivity studies here presented help in this choice, and a modified set of parameters is proposed and tested. With this set, reconstructed production profiles are close to those determined in the field, and the integrated values are retrieved with no bias and a reduced scatter (18\% at one SD) for 17 stations (cruises 3 and 4) and daily production ranging from 0.3 to 2.3 gC m-2.},

Regression models predicting daily GPP explained between 29\% and 86\% of the variance in Log GPP with chi a accounting for 28 to 85\% of the explained variance. Regression models differed significantly across assemblages. Chlorophyll-specific production, corrected for the effect of temperature, declined with increasing chi a standing stock presumably because of increased self shading, and was lower in stream periphyton than in lake or marine phytoplankton presumably because of reduced nutrient diffusion in algal mats. Gross primary production was more intensely related to water temperature in stream periphyton (Q(10) = 2.5) than in either ocean phytoplankton (Q(10) = 1.2) or lake phytoplankton (Q(10) = 1.4). Precision measured as the error factor (EF) by which means have to be multiplied or divided to obtain the limits of a 95\% confidence interval, was lower for regression estimates of daily production (EF = 3.4-6.7) and for production integrated over time (EF = 3.4) than for measurements of daily production (EF = 1.2-2). Considering the reduced effort required to obtain estimates of primary production using these regression models, we argue that they could be useful when coarse production estimates are sufficient or when adequate resources are not available to make direct measurements.},

For 150 years, it was dredged and dammed regularly without any impact analysis being made. The cumulative impact of dredging and damming on large rivers such as the St. Lawrence is an issue with only qualitative answers. Bidimensional hydrodynamics was used to simulate ancient flow conditions and to produce quantitative descriptors. Two Numerical Field Models (NFM) were prepared, one representing present state geometry, which contains 300,000 sounding points, and the other representing pristine stare, based on 1900 and 1870 measurements and containing 70,000 soundings. These two NFMs were compared, showing important changes in the morphology of the lake. The NFMs were then used for bidimensional hydrodynamic simulations of both actual and pristine states for 3 different discharges: 5,000 m(3)/s, 7,500 m(3)/s, and 10,000 m(3)/s. Results highlight the cumulative physical transformation of the system. Hydrodynamic simulations and velocity differences show an increase of velocities over shoals for discharge under 8,800 m(3)/s, and a decrease of velocities in deeper water for the same range of discharge. Dredging and straightening around Cornwall Island resulted in changes from 64\% to 71\% of the total river flow passing through the south channel while the flow in the north channel decreased from 36\% to 29\%. These hydrodynamic transformations had a definitive impact on sedimentation and most probably on aquatic plans distribution.},

  abstract = {Lake Saint-Francois is the first fluvial lake downstream of the Great Lakes. Aquatic macrophytes are abundant because of water level stabilization and increased nutrient loads. The influence of plants on flow modification is very important and must be considered in order to simulate hydrodynamic conditions. The spatial distribution of plant species is linked to their instream flow preferences. Several abiotic variables are of importance: Light penetration, wave energy, current velocity, nutrients in substrate and physical characteristics of the substrate are controlling the species and their biomass. Field characterization of macrophytes was performed using echosounder transects in association with a submersible video camera. This technique allowed the calibration of each echofacies for species identification and their relative proportion, height and density. The main eleven assemblages appear to be strongly correlated with abiotic conditions. A basic interpretation key was set up in order to describe plant distribution over the entire lake. Species, relative proportion, density and plant height were interpolated between transects. This information is used to adjust the Manning's friction coefficient for each assemblage. Simulations of the flow fields with plants and in absence of plants show a contrasted pattern. During the summer (with plants), the flow is mainly concentrated in deep channels where velocities are clearly increased by approximately 20\% compared to spring-fall simulation (without plants).},

Conventionally, the conclusion on the actual type of functional response for a given zooplankton species is made based upon laboratory analysis on experimental feeding. In this paper, we show that such an approach can be too simplistic and misleading. Based on real ocean data obtained from three expeditions of R/V Jan Mayen in the Barents Sea in 2003-2005, we demonstrate that vertical heterogeneity in algal distribution as well as active vertical movement of herbivorous zooplankton can modify the type of trophic response completely. In particular, we found that the rate of average intake of algae by Calanus glacialis exhibits a Holling type III response, instead of Holling type I or 11 found previously in laboratory experiments. We argue that this conceptual discrepancy is due to the ability of the zooplankton to feed in layers with high algal density and to avoid depths with lower algal density. Since theoretical studies would predict enhancing in system stability in the case of Holling type III, our results may be of importance for understanding the main factors controlling plankton dynamics.

Integrated mixed layer samples of lake water were concurrently collected, and a multivariate approach was used to model Kd with a number of optical and chemical variables. Substantial variation in transparency was observed among lakes. Attenuation depths (z) for UV-B radiation ranged from several centimeters to {$>$} 10 m. In some shallow, low DOC (dissolved organic C) lakes typical of high elevation ecosystems, substantial fluxes of UVR penetrated the entire water column. In deeper lakes with low DOC concentrations, high fluxes of UVR were found in a significant proportion of the mixed layer. Much of the among-lake variation in \& (87-96\%) was explained by differences in DOC concentration, which strongly influenced dissolved absorbance. On average, dissolved absorbance accounted for between 33\% (for PAR) and 68\% (for 305 nm) of Kd measured in situ. Throughout the solar UV-A and UV-B range, Kd was best estimated with a univariate power model based solely on DOC concentration. Models are also presented that relate absorption coefficients to Kd. These models can be used with archival DOC or color data to provide approximate estimates of UV transparency of lakes.},

Diffuse attenuation coefficients (K-dUV) in the epilimnia of these lakes varied seasonally (39-81\% decline from maximum Kd(320nm)), with minimum K-dUV values occurring near summer solstice. Declines in K-dUV corresponded to reductions in UV absorbance by dissolved material (a(dUV)), caused by declines in both DOC concentration and UV absorptivity (a(d):[DOC]). The seasonal decline in K-dUV was also accompanied by substantial increases in an absorption coefficient ratio (a(d250nm): a(d365nm)) and decreases in spectral slopes (S). Experimental studies of photochemical degradation were also performed using filtered lake water and natural sunlight. Exposure to solar radiation produced a number of changes in optical parameters and DOC that resembled those observed in the water column: a(dUV) (-35 to -52\%), UV absorptivity (-31 to -48\%), a(d250nm):a(d365nm) (0 to + 39\%), spectral slope, S (0 to 27\%), and DOC concentration 0 to 20\%). Changes in a(dUV) were correlated with absorbed UV dose. The derived rate constants were used in a model to estimate the contribution of photochemical degradation of DOC to water column declines in K-dUV. Results suggest that rates of photochemical degradation were sufficient to account for the summer reductions in K-dUV.

Solar irradiation caused a decrease in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and in the fluorescence peak intensity (FI) of fulvic acid (FA)- and protein-like substances in DOM. Mineralization of DOC during an irradiation period (13 days) was observed to be higher in upstream samples (32-36\%) compared to that in downstream sample (16\%). DOC concentration in samples stored in the dark significantly decreased in the downstream sample (16\%), while those in upstream samples hardly decreased (1-8\%). The FI of FA-like substance decreased by 72-84\% during 13-days irradiation (integrated solar intensity = 176 MJ m(-2)). The protein-like fluorescence was only observed in the downstream sample and the net decrease in the FI was 59\% in the irradiated sample. The first-order reaction kinetics was applied to analyze the photo degradation of DOM. Two-step photodegradation was suggested for the fluorescent DOM (FDOM), while not for the DOC. Results obtained here suggested that FA-like FDOM is more susceptible to photodegradation compared with those of protein-like substances and DOC.},

What are the potentials and where are the problems? To find an answer to these questions, the different scientific roots of ecosystem theories are briefly presented, whereby a focus is put on systems analytical sources, such as cybernetics, control theory, information theory, network theory, thermodynamics, the theory of self-organization and emergence, and hierarchy theory. After these approaches have been characterized, some unifying and integrating concepts are proposed. Finally, the present problems and the future tasks of ecosystem theory are discussed.

The experiments were carried out in 11-m(3) floating mesocosm bags deployed in the Rauneljord, near Bergen, Norway, and operated in a chemostat (flow-through) mode. Copper speciation was controlled by the formation of very strong organic complexes (log K-1' = 15.2-15.8; log K-2' = 13.0-13.4) whose likely source was the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. Strong ligand concentrations were comparable to dissolved Cu levels. This covariation kept the free Cu2+ concentration within the range of 10(-12.4) to 10(-11.2) mol L-1, i.e., below the toxicity threshold for Synechococcus. Weaker ligands (log K-3' = 8.2-9.4) were released during-and up to 4 d following-the exponential growth of algae. During this period, the weaker Cu-binding ligands appeared to have the same source or production process as the proteinlike fluorophores detected in these coastal waters. Zinc speciation was controlled by complexation with a single class of organic ligands that appeared to be released inadvertently upon the death and/or grazing of phytoplankton. Labile manganese fluctuations were inversely synchronized with the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria until the coastal waters experienced a massive rain event on day 17 of the experiment. The rainfall, which was a source of nitrogen and micronutrients, appeared to stimulate the growth of larger cells (diatoms) but to inhibit that of the smaller cells (heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria).},

  abstract = {Studies looking at the effects of forest land cover on streamflow in Quebec have shown that a decrease in forest cover in a watershed leads to an increase in minimum flows. However, in many watersheds, such a decrease in forest cover is primarily due to an increase in agricultural land use. The goal of the study was to analyze the impact of a change from forest to agriculture land cover on the spatial variability of maximum and minimum extreme flows measured in summer (May-October) in 36 watersheds with surface areas between 200 km(2) and 4000 km(2), over the period from 1960 to 1990 using the canonical correlation analysis and analysis of covariance methods. The main result of this study is the fact that, in watersheds characterized by relatively high agricultural land cover ({$>$}20\%), daily minimum flows are relatively small. The decrease in daily minimum flows associated with an increase in agricultural land cover is likely the result of relatively extensive evaporation due to the low-permeability (clayey) and nearly flat substrate in the farmland-dominated St. Lawrence Lowlands, as well as by high summer temperatures and, at times, relatively long dry spells. Hence, in Quebec, agricultural land use results in an inversion of the hydrological effects of a decrease in forest cover on extreme minimum flows. As for daily maximum flows, an increase of agricultural land cover results in a significant increase in the variability (coefficient of variation) of their magnitude, although this is only observed during the last part of the summer season (September-October), likely as a result of the diversity of factors which cause floods (tropical cyclones, polar fronts, convection, etc.).

Using under-ice hydrographic data collected near the ice-edge of a shallow Arctic bay, we documented an ice-edge upwelling event that brought nutrient-rich waters to the surface during June 2008. The event resulted in a 3-week long phytoplankton bloom that produced an estimated 31 g C m(-2) of new production. This value was approximately twice that of previous estimates for annual production in the region, demonstrating the importance of ice-edge upwelling to the local marine ecosystem. Under-ice primary production estimates of up to 0.31 g C m(-2) d(-1) showed that this production was not negligible, contributing up to 22\% of the daily averaged production of the ice-edge bloom. It is suggested that under-ice blooms are a widespread yet under-documented phenomenon in polar regions, which could increase in importance with the Arctic's thinning ice cover and subsequent increase in transmitted irradiance to the under-ice environment.

  abstract = {It has been common practice in scientific studies to assume negligible phytoplankton production when the ocean is ice-covered, due to the strong light attenuation properties of snow, sea ice, and ice algae. Recent observations of massive under-ice blooms in the Arctic challenge this concept and call for a re-evaluation of light conditions prevailing under ice during the melt period. Using hydrographic data collected under landfast ice cover in Resolute Passage, Nunavut, Canada between 9 May and 21 June 2010, we documented the exponential growth phase of a substantial under-ice phytoplankton bloom. Numerous factors appeared to influence bloom initiation: (1) transmitted light increased with the onset of snowmelt and termination of the ice algal bloom; (2) initial phytoplankton growth resulted in the accumulation of biomass below the developing surface melt layer where nutrient concentrations were high and turbulent mixing was relatively low; and (3) melt pond formation rapidly increased light transmission, while spring-tidal energy helped form a surface mixed layer influenced by ice melt-both were believed to influence the final rapid increase in phytoplankton growth. By the end of the study, nitrate+nitrite was depleted in the upper 10 m of the water column and the under-ice bloom had accumulated 508 mg chl a m(-2) with a new production estimate of 17.5 g C m(-2) over the upper 50 m of the water column. The timing of bloom initiation with melt onset suggests a strong link to climate change where sea ice is both thinning and melting earlier, the implication being an earlier and more ubiquitous phytoplankton bloom in Arctic ice-covered regions.},

Using parallel factor analysis, we identified nine independent fluorescent components present in varying concentrations in the ocean and in ballast water. One component was sufficient for predicting the coastal vs oceanic source of most ballast water samples. Across nine cruises, thresholds (1.7 and 0.7 ppb quinine sulfate equivalent units) at two fixed wavelength pairs (lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 320/414 and 370/496 nm, respectively) discriminated coastal from oceanic ballast water in {$>$}95\% of samples (N = 514). Our results suggest that single- and dual-channel fluorometers could be optimized for verifying ballast water exchange.},

Samples collected on trans-oceanic cruises in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans were used to investigate the optical characteristics of dissolved organic matter in waters with limited freshwater influence (salinity {$>$}30). Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) of fluorescence spectra revealed that coastal and oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence could be separated into at least eight separate components: 4-5 humic-like and 3-5 protein-like signals. Two of the humic components were identified as representing terrestrial organic matter and their signals could be traced in the open ocean (Pacific and Atlantic) at levels of approximately 1.5\% of riverine concentrations. An additional humic component, traditionally identified as the "marine" or "M" peak, was found to be both sourced from land and produced in the ocean. These results demonstrate that the supply, mixing and removal of terrestrial organic matter in oceanic waters can be observed with relatively simple measurement techniques, suggesting that fluorescence spectroscopy could play a useful role in future studies of the origin and fate of DOM in oceanic environments.

While a potentially powerful technique, a single widely implemented standard method for correcting and presenting fluorescence measurements is lacking, leading to difficulties when comparing data collected by different research groups. This paper reports on a large-scale interlaboratory comparison in which natural samples and well-characterized fluorophores were analyzed in 20 laboratories in the U.S., Europe, and Australia. Shortcomings were evident in several areas, including data quality-assurance, the accuracy of spectral correction factors used to correct EEMs, and the treatment of optically dense samples. Data corrected by participants according to individual laboratory procedures were more variable than when corrected under a standard protocol. Wavelength dependency in measurement precision and accuracy were observed within and between instruments, even in corrected data. In an effort to reduce future occurrences of similar problems, algorithms for correcting and calibrating EEMs are described in detail, and MATLAB scripts for implementing the study's protocol are provided. Combined with the recent expansion of spectral fluorescence standards, this approach will serve to increase the intercomparability of DOM fluorescence studies.},

In contrast, no mortality was observed in C. obscuripes at the same or even at a higher dose (85.1 J cm-2). Several UV-absorbing compounds identified as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) were found by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis in C. obscuripes [mean total MAAs: 0.142 \{micro\}g mg-1 dry weight (DW)], but not in C. pallidus. Larvae of C. flavicans also had the same suite of MAAs (shinorine, mycosporine-glycine, palythine, usujirene and palythene) and similar MAAs concentration (0.186 \{micro\}g mg-1 DW) as C. obscuripes, whereas C. crystallinus had very low concentrations (0.008 \{micro\}g mg-1 DW) and only two MAAs. The same suite of MAAs found in larvae of C. obscuripes was also detected in pupae, adult midges and eggs of this species. Whereas C. obscuripes was able to accumulate MAAs through the diet, the origin of these secondary metabolites in the lake remains unclear. Our results indicate that sensitivity to UVR in Chaoborus is species-specific and suggest that resistance in C. obscuripes is associated with the presence of photoprotective compounds. Populations of UV-sensitive Chaoborus species may be at disadvantage in water bodies becoming more transparent to UVR as consequence of climate change.},

This study investigated the retention properties of four filter types namely, combusted GF, GF, 0.45 and 0.2 {$\mu$}m filters used in the tropical coastal waters off Mangalore on the Southwest coast of India. Significant differences were observed between the filter types. Combusted GF filters performed as well as the 0.2 {$\mu$}m membrane filters for productivity and pigment studies. Compaction of the borosilicate glass microfibers during combustion of the glass-fiber filters aided in the retention of smaller phytoplankton as observed by higher values of phytoplankton pigments and productivity measurements. Scanning electron microscopic images of combusted and non-combusted GF filters revealed that these had an average pore size of 0. 3 and 1 {$\mu$}m, respectively, explaining why the former was as efficient as the 0.2 {$\mu$}m membrane filters in their retention characteristics. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents a discussion on chromophoric dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the open ocean. Recent research has shown that the optically active fraction of dissolved organic matter (chromophoric \{DOM\} or CDOM, also called ``gelbstoff'' or ``gilvin'') plays a major role in determining underwater light availability in the open ocean. Open oceans are defined as the part of the global ocean where coastal runoff and riverine input are negligible on annual time scales. Furthermore, research suggested that significant variability in \{CDOM\} concentrations occur on the seasonal to interannual time scales in the upper water column. This ``picture'' of open ocean \{CDOM\} differs from the traditional view where light absorption by \{CDOM\} was thought to be minor and that \{CDOM\} variability was not significant on annual time scales. The change in the perception toward \{CDOM\} dynamics is important because \{CDOM\} can play a direct or indirect role in climate-related biogeochemical cycles\textemdash in particular, the carbon and sulfur cycles. Absorption of light by \{CDOM\} controls ultraviolet radiation penetration into the ocean, which has an impact upon phytoplankton and bacterial productivity. \{CDOM\} is also a primary reactant in the photoproduction of CO2, CO, H2O2, and Carbonyl sulfide and is a photosensitizer in the photolysis of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Because of its impact upon the underwater light field, \{CDOM\} can influence the accuracy of global satellite-based measurements of ocean chlorophyll and primary productivity.},

  abstract = {The distribution and optical absorption characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were systematically investigated along three meridional transects in the North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea conducted as part of the 2003 US CLIVAR/CO2 Repeat Hydrography survey. Hydrographic transects covered in aggregate a latitudinal range of 5 degrees to 62 degrees north along longitudes 20 degrees W (line A16N, Leg 1), 52 degrees W (A20), and 66 degrees W (A22). Absorption spectra of filtered seawater samples were collected and analyzed for depths ranging from the surface to similar to 6000m, sampling all the ocean water masses in the western basin of the subtropical North Atlantic and several stations on the North and South American continental slopes. The lowest surface abundances of CDOM ({$<$} 0.1 m(-1) absorption coefficient at 325 nm) were found in the central subtropical gyres while the highest surface abundances (similar to 0.7 m(-1)) were found along the continental shelves and within the subpolar gyre, confirming recent satellite-based assessments of surface CDOM distribution. Within the ocean interior, CDOM abundances were relatively high (0.1-0.2 m(-1) absorption coefficient at 325 nm) except in the subtropical mode water, where a local minimum exists due to the subduction of low CDOM surface waters during mode water formation. In the subthermocline water masses of the western basin, changes in CDOM abundance are not correlated with increasing ventilation age as assessed using chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) concentrations and the atmospheric CFC history. But dissolved organic carbon (DOC) mass-specific absorption coefficients of CDOM increase with increasing ventilation age in the deep sea, indicating that CDOM is a refractory component of the DOC pool. The overall CDOM distribution in the North Atlantic reflects the rapid advection and mixing processes of the basin and demonstrates that remineralization in the ocean interior is not a significant sink for CDOM. This supports the potential of CDOM as a tracer of ocean circulation processes for subducted water masses. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, a much weaker correspondence is found for the Atlantic (R-2 {$<$} 0.05). Strong correlation between CDOM and AOU indicates that CDOM is created as a byproduct of the oxidation of organic matter from sinking particles. The observed meridional-depth sections of CDOM result from a balance between biogeochemical processes (autochthonous production and solar bleaching) and the meridional overturning circulation. Rapid mixing in the Atlantic dilutes CDOM in the interior and implies that the time scale for CDOM accumulation is greater than similar to 50 years. CDOM emerges as a unique tracer for diagnosing changes in biogeochemistry and the overturning circulation, similar to dissolved oxygen, with the additional feature that it can be quantified from satellite observation.

In this review, we discuss the global distribution and dynamics of CDOM in the ocean, concentrating on developments in the past 10 years and restricting our discussion to open ocean and deep ocean (below the main thermocline) environments. CDOM has been demonstrated to exert primary control on ocean color by its absorption of light energy, which matches or exceeds that of phytoplankton pigments in most cases. This has important implications for assessing the ocean biosphere via ocean color-based remote sensing and the evaluation of ocean photochemical and photobiological processes. The general distribution of CDOM in the global ocean is controlled by a balance between production (primarily microbial remineralization of organic matter) and photolysis, with vertical ventilation circulation playing an important role in transporting CDOM to and from intermediate water masses. Significant decadal-scale fluctuations in the abundance of global surface ocean CDOM have been observed using remote sensing, indicating a potentially important role for CDOM in ocean-climate connections through its impact on photochemistry and photobiology.},

The opposite slopes of Lower Nahal Oren, Mount Carmel, Israel, designated 'Evolution Canyon', display dramatic biotic contrasts. Higher solar radiation on the south-facing slope (S-slope) makes it spatiotemporally more heterogeneous, warmer, drier and fluctuating than the north-facing slope (N-slope). Consequently, local biodiversity differentiation across several hundred metres displays globally divergent patterns. In different groups of organisms (i.e. across phylogeny) the 'tropical Asian-African' S-slope harbours African and Asian xeric tropical biota. The S-slope is richer on average in terrestrial species, displaying higher genetic diversity than the 'temperate European' N-slope, which is richer in aquatic-dependent taxa. Adaptive differences in different organisms are demonstrated within and between the slopes. Microclimatic aridity diversifying selection seems here a major evolutionary force that drives adaptive molecular and organismal evolution. Present results suggest that 'Evolution Canyon' provides a fertile local testing model of evolutionary predictions.}

Fluxes of P from the sediments to the water column, referred to as internal P loading, often delays the recovery of water quality following a reduction in external P loads. Here, we report on the vertical distribution and geochemistry of P, lanthanum (La), iron (Fe) and carbon (C) in the culturally eutrophied Lake Bromont. This lake underwent remediation treatment using La modified bentonite (LMB) commercially available as Phoslock\texttrademark. We investigated the effectiveness of LMB in decreasing soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) availability in sediments and in reducing dissolved fluxes of P across the sediment\textendash water interface. Sediment cores were retrieved before and after LMB treatment at three sites representing bottom sediment, sediment influenced by lakeside housing and finally littoral sediment influenced by the lake inflow. Sequential extractions were used to assess changes in P speciation. Depth profiles of dissolved porewater concentrations were obtained after LMB treatment at each site. Results indicate that SRP extracted from the sediments decreased at all sites, while total extracted P (P               TOT               ) bound to redox-sensitive metal oxides increased.               31               P NMR data on P extract reveals that 20\textendash 43\% of total solid-phase P is in the form of organic P (P               org               ) susceptible to be released               via               microbial degradation. Geochemical modelling of porewater data provides evidence that LaPO               4(s)               mineral phases, such as rhabdophane and/or monazite, are likely forming. However, results also suggest that La               3+               binding by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) hinders La-phosphate precipitation. We rely on thermodynamic modelling to suggest that high Fe               2+               would bind to DOC instead of La               3+               , therefore promoting P sequestrations by LMB under anoxic conditions.},

Water samples were collected at nine sampling times to reflect a variation of the river water level. A dramatic increase was observed for chemical oxygen demand (COD) versus biochemical oxygen demand, suggesting that non-biodegradable organic components may be more contained in the organic matters driven by the storm. Specific UV absorbance values increased from 2.15 to 3.16 L/mgC-m, reaching the maximum level at the highest water level. The storm runoff resulted in the reduction of protein-like fluorescence (PLF), the increase of fulvic-like and humic-like fluorescence for the synchronous fluorescence spectra of DOM. Weight-average molecular weight (MWw) values increased from 1,100 to 1,510 Da due to the increment of high MW fractions in the SEC chromatograms. Overall changes in DOM composition may be explained by the inflow of soil-derived DOM from the upstream basins brought by the storm. The humification index (HIX) exhibited a positive correlation with MWw values, suggesting that HIX may be suggested to a prediction descriptor for DOM MW during the storm event. PLF presented a negative correlation with DOM MW, suggesting that protein-like fluorescent compounds are associated with low MW components in the river. More input of humic substances by the storm runoff appears to shift DOM into a higher MW value as revealed by a positive correlation between MWw and hydrophobic fraction. \textcopyright{} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {Time series of irradiance data measured on sea ice with high temporal and spectral resolution are needed for advancing studies of atmosphere-ice-ocean interaction during different seasons. In particular, more observations of under-ice irradiance are needed to quantify fluxes through snow and sea ice and their seasonality, because the vertical and spectral partitioning of solar radiation are still among the biggest unknowns in today's descriptions of sea-ice related processes. Our current understanding of the interaction of radiation and sea ice is based on only a few data sets, yet this interaction is crucial for describing such processes as sea-ice formation, snow metamorphism, and snow and ice melt, as well as biological productivity and abundance. A modern setup for synchronous, autonomous, continuous, and high temporal-resolution measurements of spectral albedo and transmittance of sea ice is presented. The setup is based on three spectral radiometers, covering a wavelength range from 320 to 950. nm with 3.3. nm spectral resolution. Sensors, data logger, and their setup have worked well in several campaigns under challenging climatic conditions. The longest campaign lasted more than 4. months, without the need for maintenance, and the sensors have shown good performance related to surface contamination, one of the most challenging aspects for radiation measurements. Measured data are of high quality, including details of spectral shapes and high sensitivity to changes in observed snow and ice conditions. All spectra are calibrated for absolute readings, allowing applications in a wide variety of snow and ice studies and their comparison. A sample data set, collected over two weeks in the central Arctic, is presented and shows how the vertical partitioning of irradiance changes during the transition from summer to autumn. The main advantage of the system is its suitability for autonomous and long-term observations over and under sea ice. Furthermore, the setup is portable and robust, and can be easily and quickly installed, which is most valuable for deployment under harsh conditions and also encourages short observation periods. Spectral range and other technical features permit the application of this setup for various interdisciplinary studies, too. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Arctic sea ice has declined and become thinner and younger (more seasonal) during the last decade. One consequence of this is that the surface energy budget of the Arctic Ocean is changing. While the role of surface albedo has been studied intensively, it is still widely unknown how much light penetrates through sea ice into the upper ocean, affecting sea-ice mass balance, ecosystems, and geochemical processes. Here we present the first large-scale under-ice light measurements, operating spectral radiometers on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) under Arctic sea ice in summer. This data set is used to produce an Arctic-wide map of light distribution under summer sea ice. Our results show that transmittance through first-year ice (FYI, 0.11) was almost three times larger than through multi-year ice (MYI, 0.04), and that this is mostly caused by the larger melt-pond coverage of FYI (42 vs. 23\%). Also energy absorption was 50\% larger in FYI than in MYI. Thus, a continuation of the observed sea-ice changes will increase the amount of light penetrating into the Arctic Ocean, enhancing sea-ice melt and affecting sea-ice and upper-ocean ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Transmission of sunlight into and through sea ice is of critical importance for sea-ice associated organisms and photosynthesis because light is their primary energy source. The amount of visible light transferred through sea ice contributes to the energy budget of the sea ice and the uppermost ocean. However, our current knowledge on the amount and distribution of light under sea ice is still restricted to a few local observations, and our understanding of light-driven processes and interdisciplinary interactions is still sparse. The main reasons are that the under-ice environment is difficult to access and that measurements require large logistical and instrumental efforts. Hence, it has not been possible to map light conditions under sea ice over larger areas and to quantify spatial variability on different scales. Here we present a detailed methodological description for operating spectral radiometers on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) under sea ice. Recent advances in ROV and radiation-sensor technology have allowed us to map under-ice spectral radiance and irradiance on floe scales within a few hours of station time. The ROV was operated directly from the sea ice, allowing for direct relations of optical properties to other sea-ice and surface features. The ROV was flown close to the sea ice in order to capture small-scale variability. Results from the presented data set and similar future studies will allow for better quantification of light conditions under sea ice. The presented experiences will support further developments in order to gather large data sets of under-ice radiation for different ice conditions and during different seasons.},

Light transmittance is highly variable in space and time since thickness and physical properties of snow and sea ice are highly heterogeneous on variable time and length scales. We present field measurements of under-ice irradiance along transects under undeformed land-fast sea ice at Barrow, Alaska (March, May, and June 2010). The measurements were performed with a spectral radiometer mounted on a floating under-ice sled. The objective was to quantify the spatial variability of light transmittance through snow and sea ice, and to compare this variability along its seasonal evolution. Along with optical measurements, snow depth, sea ice thickness, and freeboard were recorded, and ice cores were analyzed for chlorophyll a and particulate matter. Our results show that snow cover variability prior to onset of snow melt causes as much relative spatial variability of light transmittance as the contrast of ponded and white ice during summer. Both before and after melt onset, measured transmittances fell in a range from one third to three times the mean value. In addition, we found a twentyfold increase of light transmittance as a result of partial snowmelt, showing the seasonal evolution of transmittance through sea ice far exceeds the spatial variability. However, prior melt onset, light transmittance was time invariant and differences in under-ice irradiance were directly related to the spatial variability of the snow cover.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in freshwater ecosystems has its origin in a multitude of terrestrial and aquatic sources which determine amount, composition and thereby its functions. Spectroscopic methods are used to characterize chromophoric DOM. Among these methods, absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy can provide indications of sources, behavior, and biogeochemical cycling of DOM. Since DOM is defined as the part of the organic matter pool which passes filters from 0.22 to 0.7{$\mu$}m, sample filtration is required before spectroscopic measurements can be done. However, the use of different filter types might be influencing the results of DOM composition measurements. In order to assess the effect of different filters, we used three filter types with nominal pore sizes of 0.7, 0.45 or 0.22{$\mu$}m, measured difference spectra, calculated spectroscopic indexes (S275-295, S350-400, Sr, SUVA254, E2:E3, fluorescence index, {$\beta$}:{$\alpha$}, humification index) and fluorescence components (parallel factor analysis, PARAFAC), obtained via spectroscopic measurements from water with different characteristics (e.g. river water, wetland, sewage effluent). Our results show that the filter types had significant but small effects on the chromophoric DOM composition and that meta-analyses of DOM composition based on studies with different pore size can be done, when keeping potential minor filtration effects in mind. This is important for further meta-analysis which might inter-compare data sets on spectroscopic characterization of DOM. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier GmbH.},

Samples were collected from melted bulk sea ice, sea ice brines, surface gap layer waters, and seawater during three expeditions: one during the spring to summer and two during the winter to spring transition period. Variability in both physical (temperature and salinity) and biogeochemical parameters (dissolved and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, as well as chlorophyll a) was observed during and between studies, but CDOM absorption coefficients measured at 375 nm (a375) did not differ significantly. Distinct peaked absorption spectra were consistently observed for bulk ice, brine, and gap water, but were absent in the seawater samples. Correlation with the measured physical and biogeochemical parameters could not resolve the source of these peaks, but the shoulders and peaks observed between 260 and 280 nm and between 320 to 330 nm respectively, particularly in the samples taken from high light-exposed gap layer environment, suggest a possible link to aromatic and mycosporine-like amino acids. Sea ice CDOM susceptibility to photo-bleaching was demonstrated in an in situ 120 hour exposure, during which we observed a loss in CDOM absorption of 53\% at 280 nm, 58\% at 330 nm, and 30\% at 375 nm. No overall coincidental loss of DOC or DON was measured during the experimental period. A relationship between the spectral slope (S) and carbon-specific absorption (a375) indicated that the characteristics of CDOM can be described by the mixing of two broad end-members; and aged material, present in brine and seawater samples characterised by high S values and low a375; and a fresh material, due to elevated in situ production, present in the bulk ice samples characterised by low S and high a375. The DOC data reported here have been used to estimate that approximately 8 Tg C yr1 (11\% of annual sea ice algae primary production) may be exported to the surface ocean during seasonal sea ice melt in the form of DOC.},

The study was conducted by investigating littoral cladoceran populations in different zones (inside, at the edge and outside the macrophyte stands) in two basins with divergent water quality. No tendency towards diurnal migration related to emergent macrophytes was observed in the clear-water, mesotrophic Isontalonselk\"a basin. The dominating cladoceran, Daphnia spp., formed highest densities during daytime in the outer zone. Meanwhile, strong nocturnal cladoceran density peaks in all zones, simultaneous with lowered pH, were witnessed in the very turbid, hypertrophic Kirkkoj\"arvi basin. Reverse horizontal migration was observed in large-bodied filter feeders, Limnosida frontosa and Sida crystallina, conceivably due to predation avoidance from young-of-the-year fish aggregating within the vegetation during the day.},

The accuracy of the modelled mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at the top of the permafrost is {$\pm$}2 \textdegree C when compared to permafrost borehole data. The modelled permafrost area (MAGT \textexclamdown 0 \textdegree C) covers 13.9 \texttimes{} 106 km2 (ca. 15\% of the exposed land area), which is within the range or slightly below the average of previous estimates.

  abstract = {Light availability is of primary importance to the ecological function of shallow estuaries. For example, benthic primary production by submerged aquatic vegetation is contingent upon light penetration to the seabed. A major component that attenuates light in estuaries is colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). CDOM is often measured via a proxy, fluorescing dissolved organic matter (fDOM), due to the ease of in situ fDOM sensor measurements. Fluorescence must be converted to CDOM absorbance for use in light attenuation calculations. However, this CDOM\textendash fDOM relationship varies among and within estuaries. We quantified the variability in this relationship within three estuaries along the mid-Atlantic margin of the eastern United States: West Falmouth Harbor (MA), Barnegat Bay (NJ), and Chincoteague Bay (MD/VA). Land use surrounding these estuaries ranges from urban to developed, with varying sources of nutrients and organic matter. Measurements of fDOM (excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 nm ({$\pm$}5 nm) and 460 nm ({$\pm$}40 nm), respectively) and CDOM absorbance were taken along a terrestrial-to-marine gradient in all three estuaries. The ratio of the absorption coefficient at 340 nm (m-1) to fDOM (QSU) was higher in West Falmouth Harbor (1.22) than in Barnegat Bay (0.22) and Chincoteague Bay (0.17). The CDOM : fDOM absorption ratio was variable between sites within West Falmouth Harbor and Barnegat Bay, but consistent between sites within Chincoteague Bay. Stable carbon isotope analysis for constraining the source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in West Falmouth Harbor and Barnegat Bay yielded {$\delta$}13C values ranging from -19.7 to -26.1 \textperthousand{} and -20.8 to -26.7 \textperthousand, respectively. Concentration and stable carbon isotope mixing models of DOC (dissolved organic carbon) indicate a contribution of 13C-enriched DOC in the estuaries. The most likely source of 13C-enriched DOC for the systems we investigated is Spartina cordgrass. Comparison of DOC source to CDOM : fDOM absorption ratios at each site demonstrates the relationship between source and optical properties. Samples with 13C-enriched carbon isotope values, indicating a greater contribution from marsh organic material, had higher CDOM : fDOM absorption ratios than samples with greater contribution from terrestrial organic material. Applying a uniform CDOM : fDOM absorption ratio and spectral slope within a given estuary yields errors in modeled light attenuation ranging from 11 to 33 \% depending on estuary. The application of a uniform absorption ratio across all estuaries doubles this error. This study demonstrates that light attenuation coefficients for CDOM based on continuous fDOM records are highly dependent on the source of DOM present in the estuary. Thus, light attenuation models for estuaries would be improved by quantification of CDOM absorption and DOM source identification.},

  abstract = {The use of fluorescence spectrometry has been suggested as a simple method to determine the extent of natural organic matter humification by quantifying the red-shifting of fluorescence emission that occurs with increasing humification. Humification indices are calculated by dividing fluorescence intensity at longer wavelengths by intensity at shorter wavelengths. These indices calculated without any specific efforts to standardize dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration will result in index values that vary with DOM concentration due to fluorescence inner-filtering effects. This study critically evaluated the effect of DOM concentration on humification index determination using organic matter isolated from field corn extract, soil: water extract, and soil fulvic acid. The results show that humification index values are sensitive to DOM concentration of the solution and are linear with respect to transmittance of the solution at the 254 nm used as the excitation wavelength. An approximate correction for DOM is to exploit the linear nature of the regression fit and to determine index values at the extrapolated 100\% transmittance value. An exact correction using explicit correction factors for both primary and secondary inner-filtration effects was shown to give humification index values that are concentration invariant when absorbance of the solution at 254 nm was less than approximately 0.3 unit. Defining the humification index as the fluorescence intensity in the 300\textendash{$>$}345 nm region divided by the sum of intensity in the 300\textendash{$>$}345 nm and 435\textendash{$>$}480 nm regions was statistically advantageous. This study suggests that for quantitative results which can be used to compare humification of natural organic matter across different studies, correction of the fluorescence emission spectra for inner-filtration effects is needed.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in many soil ecosystem functions. Multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy of DOM with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of the resulting spectral landscape has been successful in characterizing DOM from a variety of aquatic sources. This study was conducted to assess the multi-way PARAFAC approach for quantitatively characterizing the fluorescent landscapes of DOM from aqueous extracts of soils and soil amendments. The DOM was extracted from plant biomass representative of crop, wetlands, and tree species; animal manures; and soils from controlled studies of cropping systems with known histories of organic amendments. The fluorescence landscape spectra were collected in the excitation range from 240 to 400 nm and emission range from 300 to 500 nm in 3-nm increments. The excitation and emission spectra modeled from the PARAFAC analysis showed that the plant biomass, animal manure, and soil DOM contained five fluorescing components: tryptophan-like (peak location at excitation 270 nm, emission 354 nm), tyrosine-like (273/309 mm), and three humic-substance-like components ({$>$} 240/465 am, 306/405 nm, and 315/447 mm). Principal component analysis of the concentration loading showed that the soil-derived DOM was very similar despite the different types and quantities of organic amendments incorporated in the different cropping systems. This study shows that PARAFAC analysis of multidimensional fluorescence spectra can model the chemical profile of terrestrial DOM in a chemically meaningful way. This represents a significant advance over current approaches to interpreting the complex DOM fluorescence spectra.},

  abstract = {The potential strengths and limitations of the Landsat systems for water clarity and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measurement were evaluated in Minnesota in the summers of 2013 and 2014. Optical water quality characteristics, including chlorophyll a, total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and CDOM were collected along with imagery from Landsats 7 and 8. Sites represented a wide range of concentrations of CDOM, chlorophyll, and mineral suspended solids (MSS), the primary factors that affect reflectance. Clear images from September 24, 2013 (Landsat 7) and September 16, 2013 (Landsat 8) acquired for northern Minnesota eight days apart allowed comparison of the respective ETM+ and OLI sensors for CDOM measurements. We examined a wide variety of potential band and band ratio models and found some two-variable models that included the NIR band worked well for Landsat 8 (R2=0.82) and reasonably well for Landsat 7 (R2=0.74). The commonly used green/red model had a poor fit for both sensors (R2=0.24, 0.25), and five sites with high MSS were clear outliers. Exclusion of these sites and other sites not included with the Landsat 7 dataset yielded a less optically complex subset of 20 coincident lakes. For this subset strong models were found for many band and band ratio models, including the commonly used green/red model with R2=0.79 for Landsat 7 and R2=0.81 for Landsat 8. The less optically complex subset may explain why the green/red model has worked well in other areas. For optically complex waters CDOM models that used the new Landsat 8 ultra-blue and narrower NIR band worked best for the full dataset indicating that the new bands and other Landsat 8 characteristics, such as higher radiometric sensitivity and improved signal-to-noise ratios, improve CDOM measurements. For water clarity measured as Secchi depth (SD), we compared September 1, 2008 Landsat 7 and August 22, 2013 Landsat 8 images from path 28 using stepwise regression to identify the best model using all bands and band ratios including the new blue and narrower NIR band. The best water clarity model for Landsat 8 used the OLI 2/4 band ratio plus OLI band 1 and was nearly identical with a model using the OLI 2/4 band ratio plus OLI band 2. The latter model is similar to the model used for previous Landsat water clarity assessments, which used the ETM+ 1/3 band ratio plus ETM+ band 1. For SD measurements we found strong relationships with both sensors, with only slight improvements for the OLI sensor for the lakes in our datasets. In contrast to some previous reports that indicated Landsat 7's ETM+ lacked sufficient sensitivity for reliable retrieval of CDOM, we found that overall both sensors worked well for water clarity and CDOM measurements. This will allow their continued use for current and historical measurements of important water characteristics on a regional scale.},

  abstract = {High-pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) has proven to be an effective method for determining the molecular weights (MW) of humic substances (HS) from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial environments. HPSEC systems often use a variable wavelength UV-vis detector, which detects the analytes based upon their chromophoric composition. HS contain a range of moieties with chromophores having unique molar absorptivities (for a given wavelength), and the calculated MW may be dependent upon the wavelength chosen for the analysis. As a consequence, the choice of wavelength becomes an important parameter for the reliable determination of MW by HPSEC. The effect of UV-vis detector wavelength on the determination of the MW distribution of selected humic and fulvic acids by HPSEC is examined in this paper. For the HS examined, both the number (M(n)) and weight average (M(w)) MW increased with increasing wavelength. The relative increase in MW was most pronounced for Lake Fryxell fulvic acid, with a 63 and 21\% increase in M(n) and M(w), respectively, between 220 and 380 nm. The increases observed for Suwannee River humic and fulvic acids were less pronounced. M(n) was more sensitive to changes in detector wavelength than M(w), and as a result the target HS appeared to be less polydisperse at higher wavelengths. Within the range of wavelengths commonly used for the determination of MW of HS by HPSEC (i.e., 220-280 nm), the magnitude of the increases in MW was not significant compared to variability in MW that results from changes to other operational parameters in HPSEC.

Only now is it becoming possible to acquire these types of observations, as we develop and deploy instruments that can continuously monitor individual organisms in the ocean. Our research group can measure and count the smallest phytoplankton cells using a submersible flow cytometer ( FlowCytobot), in which optical properties of individual suspended cells are recorded as they pass through a focused laser beam. However, FlowCytobot cannot efficiently sample or identify the much larger cells ( 10 to {$>$} 100 mu m) that often dominate the plankton in coastal waters. Because these larger cells often have recognizable morphologies, we have developed a second submersible flow cytometer, with imaging capability and increased water sampling rate ( typically, 5 mL seawater analyzed every 20 min), to characterize these nano- and microplankton. Like the original, Imaging FlowCytobot can operate unattended for months at a time; it obtains power from and communicates with a shore laboratory, so we can monitor results and modify sampling procedures when needed. Imaging FlowCytobot was successfully tested for 2 months in Woods Hole Harbor and is presently deployed alongside FlowCytobot at the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory. These combined approaches will allow continuous long- term observations of plankton community structure over a wide range of cell sizes and types, and help to elucidate the processes and interactions that control the life cycles of individual species.}

Since 2012, an array of 105 Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats has been deployed across the world's oceans to assist in filling observational gaps that are required for characterizing open-ocean environments. Profiles of biogeochemical (chlorophyll and dissolved organic matter) and optical (single-wavelength particulate optical backscattering, downward irradiance at three wavelengths, and photosynthetically available radiation) variables are collected in the upper 1000m every 1 to 10 days. The database of 9837 vertical profiles collected up to January 2016 is presented and its spatial and temporal coverage is discussed. Each variable is quality controlled with specifically developed procedures and its time series is quality-assessed to identify issues related to biofouling and/or instrument drift. A second database of 5748 profile-derived products within the first optical depth (i.e., the layer of interest for satellite remote sensing) is also presented and its spatiotemporal distribution discussed. This database, devoted to field and remote ocean color applications, includes diffuse attenuation coefficients for downward irradiance at three narrow wavebands and one broad waveband (photosynthetically available radiation), calibrated chlorophyll and fluorescent dissolved organic matter concentrations, and single-wavelength particulate optical backscattering. To demonstrate the applicability of these databases, data within the first optical depth are compared with previously established bio-optical models and used to validate remotely derived bio-optical products.

Bacterial production and abundance generally decreased from river to offshore waters and from surface to deep waters. In contrast, the percentage of high nucleic acid bacteria was higher in deep waters rather than in surface or river waters. Statistical analyses indicated that bacterial production was primarily controlled by temperature and the availability of labile organic matter, as indicated by total dissolved amino acid concentrations. Direct comparisons of bacterial carbon demand and primary production indicated net heterotrophy was common in shelf waters. Net autotrophy was observed at stations in the Mackenzie River plume, suggesting that the carbon fixed in plume waters helped fuel net heterotrophy in the Beaufort Sea margin.},

This contrasted with the experiments performed using waters from the chlorophyll maxima, where N was never limiting. Diversity analyses (DNA- and RNA-based fingerprinting) suggest that limitation was not restricted to specific operational taxonomic units but common to the different groups.

In contrast to the river and coastal waters, total (16S rDNA-based) and active (16S rRNA-based) communities in the open sea samples were not significantly different, suggesting that most present bacterial groups were equally active in this area. Additionally, we observed significant differences between PA and FL bacterial community structure in the open sea, but similar structure in the two fractions for coastal and river samples. Direct multivariate statistical analyses showed that total community structure was mainly driven by salinity (a proxy of dissolved organic carbon and chromophoric dissolved organic matter), suspended particles, amino acids and chlorophyll a. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from selected samples confirmed significant differences between river, coastal and sea samples. The PA fraction was only different (15.7\% similarity) from the FL one in the open sea sample. Furthermore, PA samples generally showed higher diversity (Shannon, Simpson and Chao indices) than FL samples. At the class level, Opitutae was most abundant in the PA fraction of the sea sample, followed by Flavobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, while the FL sea sample was dominated by Alphaproteobacteria. Finally, for the coast and river samples and both PA and FL fractions, Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria were dominant. These results highlight the coexistence of particle specialists and generalists and the role of particle quality in structuring bacterial communities in the area. These results may also serve as a basis to predict further changes in bacterial communities should climate change lead to further increases in river discharge and related particle loads.},

  abstract = {The photoreactivity of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) transported to Arctic shelf environments by rivers has only recently been studied and its quantitative role in Arctic shelf biogeochemistry has received little attention. Sunlight exposure experiments were performed on CDOM collected over a three year period (2002 to 2004) from river, estuary, shelf, and gulf regions of the Western Canadian Arctic. Decreases in CDOM absorption, synchronous fluorescence (SF), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration were followed after 3 days of exposure, and in two experiments, six optical cutoff filters were used to incrementally remove ultraviolet radiation incident on the samples. Apparent quantum yields for CDOM photobleaching (AQY(ble)) and for DOC photomineralization (AQY(min)) were computed. as were two AQY spectra (phi(ble) and phi(min)) for the Mackenzie River and a sample from the Mackenzie Shelf The photoreactivity of Mackenzie River CDOM was highest after break-up and peak discharge and lowest in late summer. The half-lives of CDOM and DOC were estimated at 3.7 days and 4.8 days, respectively. when Mackenzie River water was exposed to full sunlight. Photobleaching of Mackenzie River CDOM fluorescence after most UV-B wavelengths were removed increased the correlation between the river and offshore waters in the Beaufort Sea. When light attenuation from particle- and CDOM-rich river water was considered for the Mackenzie Shelf, our photodegradation models estimated around 10\% loss of absorption and {$<$} 1\% DOC loss, suggesting that sunlight exposure does not substantially degrade CDOM on Arctic shelves.

The results from four cruises undertaken from August 2006 to February 2007 are presented. Relationships between the optical (absorption and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved lignin concentrations were determined and carbon stable isotope values (??13C) of DOM were also used to evaluate DOM sources. Chromophoric DOM (CDOM), measured as absorption at 300nm, was a strong predictor for DOC and lignin concentrations. The DOM fluorescence (FDOM) characteristics were modeled by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and a six component model was derived. The intensity of one terrestrial humic-like fluorescent component (Fmax3) was strongly correlated to dissolved lignin concentrations. DOC concentrations were best modeled by the combination of this component with an amino acid-like fluorescent component. A three end-member mixing model developed for the region using CDOM-salinity relationships was used to estimate end-member lignin and DOC concentrations, which produced results consistent with other published results from the region. The Baltic Sea outflow was determined to be the dominant source of dissolved lignin in these waters. Despite the high riverine influence in the Jutland Coastal Current, the DOM originating from these waters contained little lignin and was predominantly autochthonous. Additionally CDOM and carbon stable isotope measurements revealed substantial autochthonous production in the Kattegat. Finally, we used the fluorescence-DOC relationships to estimate the net export of terrestrial C from the Baltic Sea at 0.8Tgyear-1, which represents 45\% of the calculated net DOC flux (1.7Tgyear-1). ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) of 27 prairie saline lake ecosystems was investigated in the Northern and Central Great Plains of the United States using absorbance, fluorescence, lignin concentration, and stable C isotope values. The majority of variation in DOM fluorescence among lakes was due to humic (peak C) and microbially formed (peak M) fluorescent components, which appear to be derived from autochthonous primary production. Strong correlations between peak M and nutrients allow us to model total phosphorus (TP) concentration using peak M fluorescence and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption. The rate of primary production (PP) was positively correlated with peak M fluorescence and negatively with lignin concentration. Lignin phenol yields in the DOM were generally smaller than those of most freshwater systems. delta C-13 values of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from -25.0\% to -20.1\% and were generally enriched relative to typical freshwaters (ca. -27\%). Terrestrial DOM is degraded in prairie lakes, spanning a gradient from mixotrophic to eutrophic, as determined by a color-nutrient model. The photodegradation of autochthonous DOM was significant: CO2 fluxes from these prairie lakes, modeled from peak M fluorescence, ranged from 5 to 228 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) (median, 37 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) and was similar to community respiration estimated from protein fluorescence (median, 50 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)). The combined estimates were about 50\% of the global mean total C release previously reported for saline lake ecosystems. The implication of these new results is that the global C release from saline lake ecosystems is likely underestimated.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Carbohydrates are important components of the carbon cycle and may be used as indicators of the origin and the diagenetic status of marine and terrestrial organic matter. Nevertheless, comprehensive studies of both particulate (PCHO) and dissolved (DCHO) carbohydrates in rivers are scarce, and the seasonal and interannual variability of these compounds in relationship to the bulk particulate (POM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) is largely unknown. For the period 2007\textendash 2009, we sampled once per month POM and DOM and measured the total suspended matter (TSM), POM, DOM, PCHO, and DCHO for the Rh\^one River, which flows into the Mediterranean Sea. Using these measurements, we estimated for the above parameters annual fluxes for the period 2007\textendash 2009. The estimated carbohydrate fluxes averaged 0.064 {$\pm$} 0.026 \texttimes{} 1010 moles C yr-1 for PCHO and 0.042 {$\pm$} 0.008 \texttimes{} 1010 moles C yr-1 DCHO, representing 6 \% and 7 \% of the annual flux of POC and DOC, respectively. During flood and low-water periods, POM variations were reflected into the PCHO pool, whereas this was not observed for DOC and DCHO, indicating a decoupling between particulate and dissolved organic matter. Our results also showed that flood and low-water periods may be differentiated using the ratios PCHO/DCHO and POC/DOC, which had a significant relationship. Based on the carbohydrate abundances in both the PCHO and DCHO pools, we conclude that this material mainly derives from allochthonous sources (vascular plants, bacteria and soils). Moreover, during flood events, an enrichment in mannose in POM was observed, probably reflecting an angiosperm source (leaves or grasses). By expanding our results to the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Gulf of Lions), we found that the total organic carbon (TOC) fluxes of the Rh\^one River accounted for {\~ }1 \% of the standing stock of seawater TOC. Considering that glucose is the most abundant carbohydrate in both particulate and dissolved organic matter pools ({\~ }33 \%), its annual flux in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea was estimated to 3.8 \texttimes{} 108 moles glucose.},

Feeding activity and body reserves of wintering great tits Parus major in response to the priority to food access were studied in two areas differing in incidence of predators.

In the two-predator area dominant great tits arrived at feeders significantly later in the morning, and left earlier in the evening, than their subordinate flock-mates. Hence, feeding day length of dominants was found to be significantly shorter. The reverse was true for the one-predator area. In addition, dominants carried significantly greater reserves than subordinates in the area inhabited by two predators. Factors constraining subcutaneous energy reserves were also studied in removal experiments. After the removal of dominant individuals, subordinate great tits did not reduce their body reserves in the two predator area. In contrast, subordinate great tits significantly reduced evening body reserves in the single-predator area. I concluded that the presence of the two predators increases unpredictability in feeding conditions for great tits. Dominant individuals responded to this by shortening their feeding day and increasing body reserves at dusk.},

This indicates CDOM as the dominant attenuator of both UV and PAR solar radiation and suggests its use as an optical proxy for DOC concentrations in this region. While the Mackenzie input is the main driver of CDOM dynamics in low salinity waters, locally, primary production can create significant increases in CDOM. Extrapolating CDOM to DOC relationships, we estimate that {$\sim$}16\% of the DOC in the Mackenzie River does not absorb radiation at 350 nm. The discharges of DOC and its chromophoric subset (CDOM) by the Mackenzie River during the MALINA cruise are estimated as {$\sim$}0.22 TgC and 0.18 TgC, respectively. Three dissolved fluorescent components (C1\textendash C3) were identified by fluorescence excitation/emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS) and parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. Our results showed an aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) component (C1), probably produced in the numerous lakes of the watershed, that co-dominated with a terrestrial humic-like component (C2) in the Mackenzie Delta Sector. This aquatic DOM could partially explain the high CDOM spectral slopes observed in the Beaufort Sea.}

Mock communities amplified with 515F-Y/926R yielded closer observed community composition versus expected (r2=0.95) compared with 515F-Y/806R (r2{$\sim$}0.5). Unexpectedly, biases with 515F-Y/806R against SAR11 in field samples ({$\sim$}4-10-fold) were stronger than in mock communities ({$\sim$}2-fold). Correcting a mismatch to Thaumarchaea in the 515F-C increased their apparent abundance in field samples, but not as much as using 926R rather than 806R. With plankton samples rich in eukaryotic DNA (\textquestiondown 1{$\mu$}m size fraction), 18S sequences averaged {$\sim$}17\% of all sequences. A single mismatch can strongly bias amplification, but even perfectly matched primers can exhibit preferential amplification.

We tested the hypotheses that: i) larval distribution is not related to habitat characteristics, presumably due to their relatively low swimming capacity, whereas ii) these environmental variables drive juvenile distribution, reflecting a more active habitat selection. This study is one of the first attempts to partition the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors in shaping the distribution of a freshwater fish through its early ontogeny. We show that larvae were not spatially aggregated within the embayments and that habitat characteristics, mainly related to aquatic vegetation, played an important role in explaining their distribution. In contrast, juvenile abundances were not significantly related to habitat characteristics, despite being spatially structured over multiple scales. Contrary to our predictions, habitat association was stronger for larvae than for juveniles which were aggregated independent of habitat characteristics. Increased swimming capacities may thus facilitate the aggregation of juveniles rather than strengthening their association with habitat, at least at the scales considered here (ca 3km2). These results shed a new light on the factors governing larval and juvenile yellow perch distribution, suggesting that active habitat choice might begin earlier than previously thought.},

The model includes an ice\&ndash;ocean boundary layer with an Ekman spiral, forced by transfers of wind-input momentum both through the sea ice and directly into the open water between the ice floes. The analytical tractability of this model allows efficient calculation of the ice velocity provided that the surface wind field is known and that the ocean geostrophic velocity is relatively weak. The model predicts that variations in the ice thickness or concentration should substantially modify the rotation of the velocity between the 10m winds, the sea ice, and the ocean. Compared to recent observational data from the first ice-tethered profiler with a velocity sensor (ITP-V), the model is able to capture the dependencies of the ice speed and the wind/ice/ocean turning angles on the wind speed. The model is used to derive responses to intensified southerlies on Arctic summer sea ice concentration, and the results are shown to compare closely with satellite observations.}

When growing on lower nutrient concentrations (f/16 medium), UV radiation had no significant effect on the production rates. The percentage of PER to the total amount of carbon fixed was similar for the PhAR + UV and the PhAR treatments. However, PER produced by C. muelleri during PhAR + UV exposure was taken up by bacterioplankton in the dark at significantly lower rates than PER produced in the absence of UV. This indicates that PER, considered as an important component of the dissolved organic carbon pool, becomes more resistant to bacterial utilization upon UV exposure. Whether this reduced PER-uptake by bacterioplankton is caused by changes in the macromolecular composition of the PER and/or is due to a subsequent photochemically induced alteration of the molecules during UV-exposure remains to be investigated.},

Up-thrusting of the peatland surface due to permafrost aggradation during the Little Ice Age resulted in the formation of an extensive peat plateau that gradually fragmented into residual palsas from the 19th century to the present. Only about 18\% of the original surface occupied by permafrost was thawed in 1957, whereas only 13\% was still surviving in 2003. Rapid permafrost melting over the last 50 years caused the concurrent formation of thermokarst ponds and fen-bog vegetation with rapid peat accumulation through natural successional processes of terrestrialization. The main climatic driver for accelerated permafrost thawing was snow precipitation which increased from 1957 to present while annual and seasonal temperatures remained relatively stable until about the mid-1990s when annual temperature rose well above the mean. Contrary to current expectations, the melting of permafrost caused by recent climate change does not transform the peatland to a carbon-source ecosystem as rapid terrestrialization exacerbates carbon-sink conditions and tends to balance the local carbon budget.

The main issues are related to preparing input data for the hydraulic model in a consistent and georeferenced database and to representing different flow regimes. Geographic information systems-based automatic procedures were developed in order to produce cross-sectional profiles that encompass the large floodplains and to link hydraulic data and spatial location. The marked seasonal flow regime and relative smooth hydrographs of Paraguay River were quite well reproduced by the hydraulic model. For the tributaries, it must be mentioned the model's ability to simulate both cases when the hydrograph does not present a marked peak flow, due to water loss for the floodplain, and when the hydrograph presents a more common shape, with recession and peak flows well defined.},

To determine the appropriateness of different UV-vis measurements we used surface and pore water samples from two Welsh peatlands in four different experiments: (i) an assessment of single wavelength proxies (1 nm increments between 230-800 nm) for DOC concentration demonstrated that 254 nm was more accurate than 400 nm. The highest R(2) values between absorbance and DOC concentration were generated using 263 nm for one sample set (R(2) = 0.91), and 230 nm for the other three sample sets (respective R(2) values of 0.86, 0.81, and 0.93). (ii) A comparison of different DOC concentration proxies, including single wavelength proxies, a two wavelength model, a proxy using phenolic concentration, and a proxy using the area under a UV spectrum at 250-350 nm. It was found that both a single wavelength proxy ({$\leq$}263 nm) and a two wavelength model performed well for both pore water and surface water. (iii) An evaluation of the E2 : E3, E2 : E4, E4 : E6 ratios, and SUVA (absorbance at 254 nm normalised to DOC concentration) as indicators of DOC quality showed that the E4 : E6 ratio was subject to extensive variation over time, and was highly correlated between surface water and pore water, suggesting that it is a useful metric to determine temporal changes in DOC quality. (iv) A repeated weekly analysis over twelve weeks showed no consistent change in UV-vis absorbance, and therefore an inferred lack of degradation of total DOC in samples that were filtered and stored in the dark at 4 \textdegree C.},

Cell volumes were measured in scanning electron micrographs. The average cell volume was 0.159 mum. Annual variations and depth distribution were studied. Production was estimated from the frequency of dividing cells and from dark radioactive sulfate uptake. Annual productivity and daily average productivity were very close with both methods: 107 to 205 g of C per m per year for sulfate and 89 to 117 g of C per m per year for frequency of dividing cells. Zooplankton feeding removed 2 to 10\% of the bacterial net production annually. When compared with biomass changes and losses due to zooplankton feeding, production values were very high. Therefore, it was suggested that other loss factors have to be more important than zooplankton feeding in controlling the bacterial population. Bacterial heterotrophic production was about 50\% of gross primary production.},

Despite expectations that the effects of connectivity would depend on levels of regional heterogeneity, no significant interactions were found for any diversity index investigated at any spatial scale. While observed responses of biodiversity to connectivity and heterogeneity depended to some extent on the diversity index and spatial partitioning formula used, the general pattern shows that these factors largely act at the {$\beta$} scale, as opposed to the {$\alpha$} or {$\gamma$} scales. We conclude that the major role of connectivity in aquatic invertebrate communities is to act as a homogenizing force with relatively little effect on diversity at the {$\alpha$} or {$\gamma$} levels. Conversely, heterogeneity acts as a force maintaining differences between communities.},

  abstract = {Predicting the potential effects of future climatic change and human disturbances on natural vegetation distribution requires large-scale biogeographical models. There have been two basic approaches to modelling vegetation response to changing climates: static (time-independent) or dynamic (time-dependent) biogeographical models. This paper reviews and compares two major types of static biogeographical models, climate-vegetation classification and plant functional type models, and the first generation of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs). These models have been widely used to simulate the potential response of vegetation to past and future climate change. Advantage and disadvantage of each type of model are discussed. Global vegetation modelling for investigations of climate change effects has progressed from empirical modelling to process-based equilibrium modelling to the first generation of DGVMs. Some DGVMs are able to capture the responses of potential natural vegetation to climate change with a strong orientation towards population processes. Nevertheless, the uncertainty around the quantitative simulated results indicates that DGVMs are still in the early stages of development. Validating and capturing disturbance-related effects are major challenges facing the developers of the next generation of DGVMs. In future, DGVMs will become an important tool for assessing the effects of climate change on potential vegetation dynamics and terrestrial carbon storage and for managing terrestrial ecosystem sustainability.

This study evaluated if leaf color change in fall (i.e., leaf yellowing) and brook trout spawning could be two biological processes that are synchronized at a regional scale and if leaf yellowing could be used to determine the peak of spawning activity of this species. To this end, we surveyed 551 brook trout redds and examined 193 digital images of forest trees in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve (Qu\'ebec, Canada) over the fall season. Results showed that leaf yellowing and brook trout spawning were synchronized, providing one of the first examples of temporal matching between freshwater and terrestrial biological processes at the regional scale. Considering the difficulty of monitoring the phenology of freshwater fish spawning at high spatial and temporal resolution, terrestrial integrators of environmental conditions, such as leaf color change, may prove to be promising predictors of spawning activity in the management of fish populations. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The erection of P. arctica is mainly supported by molecular data, since the species shares identical ultrastructure with another species in the complex, P. fryxelliana, and represents a new case of crypticity within the genus. Despite their morphological similarity, the two species are not closely related in phylogenies based on LSU, ITS and rbcL. Interestingly, P. arctica is phylogenetically most closely related to P. granii and P. subcurvata, from which the species is, however, morphologically different. P. granii and P. subcurvata lack the central larger interspace which is one of the defining features of the P. pseudodelicatissima complex. The close genetic relationship between P. arctica and the two species P. granii and P. subcurvata is demonstrated by analysis of the secondary structure of ITS2 which revealed no compensatory base changes, two hemi-compensatory base changes, and two deletions in P. arctica with respect to the other two species. These findings emphasize that rates of morphological differentiation, molecular evolution and speciation are often incongruent for Pseudo-nitzschia species, resulting in a restricted phylogenetic value for taxonomic characters used to discriminate species. The description of a new cryptic species, widely distributed in the Arctic and potentially representing an endemic component of the Arctic diatom flora, reinforces the idea of the existence of noncosmopolitan Pseudo-nitzschia species and highlights the need for combined morphological and molecular analyses to assess the distributional patterns of phytoplankton species.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis is one of the most widely applied tools in order to summarize common patterns of variation among variables. Several studies have investigated the ability of individual methods, or compared the performance of a number of methods, in determining the number of components describing common variance of simulated data sets. We identify a number of shortcomings related to these studies and conduct an extensive simulation study where we compare a larger number of rules available and develop some new methods. In total we compare 20 stopping rules and propose a two-step approach that appears to be highly effective. First, a Bartlett's test is used to test the significance of the first principal component, indicating whether or not at least two variables share common variation in the entire data set. If significant, a number of different rules can be applied to estimate the number of non-trivial components to be retained. However, the relative merits of these methods depend on whether data contain strongly correlated or uncorrelated variables. We also estimate the number of non-trivial components for a number of field data sets so that we can evaluate the applicability of our conclusions based on simulated data.},

  abstract = {Establishing relationships between species distributions and environmental characteristics is a major goal in the search for forces driving species distributions. Canonical ordinations such as redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis are invaluable tools for modeling communities through environmental predictors. They provide the means for conducting direct explanatory analysis in which the association among species can be studied according to their common and unique relationships with the environmental variables and other sets of predictors of interest, such as spatial variables. Variation partitioning can then be used to test and determine the likelihood of these sets of predictors in explaining patterns in community structure. Although variation partitioning in canonical analysis is routinely used in ecological analysis, no effort has been reported in the literature to consider appropriate estimators so that comparisons between fractions or, eventually, between different canonical models are meaningful. In this paper, we show that variation partitioning as currently applied in canonical analysis is biased. We present appropriate unbiased estimators. In addition, we outline a statistical test to compare fractions in canonical analysis. The question addressed by the test is whether two fractions of variation are significantly different from each other. Such assessment provides an important step toward attaining an understanding of the factors patterning community structure. The test is shown to have correct Type I. error rates and good power for both redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis.},

  abstract = {The optical properties of sea ice exhibit considerable spatial, temporal, and spectral variability. During a field experiment at Barrow, Alaska, we examined the horizontal variability of spectral albedo and transmittance as well as the vertical variability of in-ice radiance. Temporal changes were monitored under cold conditions in April and during the onset of melt in June. Physical properties, including ice structure and concentrations of particulate and dissolved material, were measured to provide a context for understanding the observed temporal, horizontal, vertical, and spectral variability in optical properties. For snow-covered first-year ice in April, wavelength-integrated (300-3000 nm) albedos were high (0.8) and spatially uniform, but there was considerable variability in transmittance. Transmittance at 440 nm ranged by more than a factor of 2 over horizontal distances of only 25 m, owing primarily to differences in snow depth, although spectral variations in transmittance indicate that absorbing organic materials in the ice column contribute significantly to the horizontal variability. Peak values of transmittance in April were 1\% near 500 nm, decreasing at both longer and shorter wavelengths. At the onset of melt in June, the ice surface rapidly evolved into a variegated mixture of melting snow, bare ice, and melt ponds. Albedos were much lower and exhibited considerable spatial variability, ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 over distances of a few meters concomitant with the variation in surface characteristics. Transmission increased over the spring transition as surface characteristics evolved to decrease albedo and as in-ice structure was altered by heating to reduce attenuation within the ice. The exception to this trend occurred over a period of a few days when an algal bloom developed on the underside of the ice and transmission was significantly reduced. Variability in the in-ice spectral radiance values was observed between nearby sites in both first-year and multiyear ice. While the radiance measurements are strongly dependent on the incident solar radiance, under similar solar conditions there was an observed shift in the peak of the maximum in the spectral radiance from 460 nm in clean ice to between 500 and 550 nm in ice that contained particulates in the surface layer. More impressive spectral shifts were found in an old melt pond that had accumulated particles at its base. Not only was there a strong shift in the spectral nature of the radiance as a function of horizontal distance, but there also existed large changes vertically within the ice. The vertical variability in the radiance attenuation coefficient was spatially coherent with variations in both the physical structure of the ice, especially grain size, and the concentrations of particulate and dissolved materials entrapped in the ice. Not surprisingly, the short-lived algal layer on the underside of the ice resulted in changes in the radiance attenuation coefficient from approximately 1m-1 in the interior ice to approximately 40m-1 within that layer.},

The optical properties of sea ice affect the heat and mass balance of the ice cover and the marine ecosystem. They also have climate implications through the sea ice albedo feedback.

Here we combine satellite ocean colour and sea-ice data in a pan-Arctic study. Ice-edge blooms occur in all seasonally ice-covered areas and from spring to late summer, being observed in 77-89\% of locations for which adequate data exist, and usually peaking within 20 days of ice retreat. They sometimes form long belts along the ice-edge (greater than 100 km), although smaller structures were also found. The bloom peak is on average more than 1 mg m -3 , with major blooms more than 10 mg m -3 , and is usually located close to the ice-edge, though not always. Some propagate behind the receding ice-edge over hundreds of kilometres and over several months, while others remain stationary. The strong connection between ice retreat and productivity suggests that the ongoing changes in Arctic sea-ice may have a significant impact on higher trophic levels and local fish stocks. \textcopyright{} Author(s) 2011.}

In stark contrast the ` stochastic geometry ' model assumes that a species fi ne-scale spatial distribution is independent of that of other species in the community. Empirical tests in temperate and tropical forests have provided support for both perspectives. Using point pattern analyses we assessed the prevalence of heterospecifi c associations between 10 500 pairs of species and 3400 pairs of plant functional types (PFTs) in four biodiverse shrubland communities in southwestern Australia. After controlling for fi rst-order eff ects, spatial associations between species and PFTs were rare, but were most prevalent at the least species-rich of the four sites considered. Individuals tended to have fewer species in their local neighbourhoods than expected under a null model of random relabelling, with this departure most pronounced at the site with fewest species. Th e consistency of neighbourhood composition experienced by individuals of the same species is, as a result, less than the average under random mixing. Our results demonstrate that the frequency of heterospecifi c spatial associations is both rare in speciose systems and declines with species richness, and provide further empirical support for the stochastic geometry assumption in species-rich communities.}

  abstract = {In size-structured populations, interactions are strongly dependent on size-specific foraging and anti-predator capacities of the organism. Conflicting size-specific selection pressures over the ontogeny often have different effects on different species leading to asymmetries in competitive and predator-prey interactions. Habitat complexity is likely to affect such asymmetric interactions due to species/size-specific competitive abilities in different habitats and due to the fact that habitat structural complexity may act differently as a prey refuge for different species. We experimentally analyzed the impact of a piscivorous predator (adult perch, Perca fluviatilis) on performance of juvenile perch and roach (Rutilus rutilus) at different levels of structural complexity (no structure, structure forming a partial refuge, and structure forming a complete refuge) in enclosures in an experimental pond. We measured predator diet and growth, prey fish habitat use, survival, diet and growth, and prey resource levels in different habitats. Prey fish (perch and roach) were found in the diet of piscivorous perch in no refuge and partial refuge treatments. Growth rate of the piscivorous perch decreased with increased refuge efficiency. Juvenile perch increased their proportional use of the structurally complex refuges in the presence of piscivorous perch and the survival increased with increased refuge efficiency (from partial to complete refuge). The diet of juvenile perch changed from predominantly cyclopoid copeponds in the absence of predators to predominantly macroinvertebrates in the presence of predators. There was no effect of predator-induced habitat restriction on growth of juvenile perch. Roach survival also increased with increased refuge efficiency in the presence of predators, and roach survival in the refuge treatments did not differ from each other or from the treatments with predators absent. Predator-induced habitat restriction in roach was associated with a decreased growth of roach. Our results suggest that, compared to juvenile roach, juvenile perch may compensate more for lost foraging opportunity in the open water via increased exploitation of structure-associated prey in refuges. As a result, predation-induced habitat shifts by juvenile perch and roach may alter competitive interactions between the species. On the other hand, structural complexity may form an almost complete refuge for juvenile roach from predators and thereby affect the predator-prey relationships between piscivorous perch and juvenile perch and roach to the advantage of juvenile roach. The demonstrated effects of structural complexity on competitive and predator-prey interactions between perch and roach can be related to the two species' distributions in lakes with different degrees of structural complexity.},

Although each of these themes has seen considerable attention in the modeling and forecasting communities, their joint effects remain little explored and poorly understood. We developed ecological niche models for 1804 species from the European flora, which we projected globally to identify areas of potential distribution, both at present and across 4 scenarios of future (2055) climates. As expected from previous studies, projections based on the CGCM1 climate model were more extreme than those based on the HadCM3 model, and projections based on the a2 emissions scenario were more extreme than those based on the b2 emissions scenario. However, less expected were the highly nonlinear and contrasting projected changes in distributional areas among continents: increases in distributional potential in Europe often corresponded with decreases on other continents, and species seeing expanding potential on one continent often saw contracting potential on others. In conclusion, global climate change will have complex effects on invasive potential of plant species. The shifts and changes identified in this study suggest strongly that biological communities will see dramatic reorganizations in coming decades owing to shifting invasive potential by nonnative species.}

Fish, crayfish, some mammals and birds and some other organisms use macrophytes to their benefit, such as spawning, nursery, feeding grounds and as a refuge. Macrophytes play an important role in the fish food chain, especially as a substrate for aquatic organisms on which the fish feed. Aquatic plants have a controlling effect on prey-predator interrelationships, have an important function in water quality and, hence, can be used in biomanipulation for improving fish stocks. Special plant communities, such as floating meadows of varzea and igapo, are essential for fish and fisheries in the Amazon basin, while sudd formation may lead to the reduction in fish stocks. The present review has been compiled in response to requests for an update on such interactions, and aims to assist policy planners, managers, field specialists, and other persons interested in this topic.},

  abstract = {Light transmittance through sea ice is affected by surface cover and ice optical properties in the vicinity of the measurement. We present three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of light propagation in sea ice to derive upper bounds on the lateral spread of light. Our results give guidance on equipment design and on the possibility of using one-dimensional light transfer models to describe transmittance. Rules were derived for simple cases of optically homogeneous slabs. In the absence of absorption, 10\% and 90\% of the flux detected under optically thick, homogeneous ice are incident on the surface within a radius of less than 0.3 and 2.0 times the ice thickness, respectively. Any increase in optical thickness or absorption in the ice will reduce these radii. For example, the wavelength-dependent absorption of ice results in a 20\% reduction at 700. nm. Optical anisotropy of the slab was also found to produce potentially significant spatial narrowing of the transmitted light field. In the case of direct sunlight, the photon path is displaced toward the sun relative to the location of the detector. This distortion can reach 1. m or more in optically thick, ponded ice but will be negligible under a surface scattering layer or snow cover. Case studies showed that transmittance of diffuse light in the vicinity of a semi-infinite surface obstruction could be approximated with exponential and error functions. An absorbing cylindrical perturbation of 0.05. m diameter in 1. m thick ice placed 1. m from the point of measurement will absorb less than 1\% of the light otherwise registered by the detector. Many results for transmitted light were independent of the mean cosine of the scattering phase function. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

Sampling was performed at a drinking water intake structure from May to July 2010 at three depths (3-, 10-, and 18-m) below the water surface. AF4-fractograms showed that the CDOM had diffusion coefficient peak maximums between 3.5 and 2.8 x 10{$^{-6}$} cm{$^2$} s{$^{-1}$}, which corresponded to a molecular weight range of 680-1950 Da and a size of 1.6-2.5 nm. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrices of whole water samples and AF4-generated fractions were decomposed with a PARAFAC model into five principal components. For the whole water samples, the average total maximum fluorescence was highest for the 10-m depth samples and lowest (about 40\% less) for 18-m depth samples. While humic-like fluorophores comprised the majority of the total fluorescence at each depth, a protein-like fluorophore was in the least abundance at the 10-m depth, indicating stratification of both total fluorescence and the type of fluorophores. The results present a powerful approach to investigate CDOM properties and can be extended to investigate CDOM reactivity, with particular applications in areas such as disinfection byproduct formation and control and evaluating changes in drinking water source quality driven by climate change.},

On an annual scale, Middle Lake exhibited CO(2) supersaturation, averaging 313\% (range 86-562\%), but was autotrophic with a net O(2) production (6.35 +/- A 2.05 mol m(-2) y(-1)), DIC consumption (-31.18 +/- A 18.77 mol m(-2) y(-1)) and net export of Chl a downstream (8.38 +/- A 0.95 mol C m(-2) y(-1)). Phytoplankton was the main driver of Middle Lake metabolism, with a net primary production estimated at 33.24 mol O(2) m(-2) y(-1), corresponding to a sequestration of 4.18 and 0.26 mol m(-2) y(-1) of N and P, respectively. At peak biomass, T. natans covered about 18\% of Middle Lake's surface and fixed 2.46, 0.17 and 0.02 mol m(-2) of C, N and P, respectively. Surficial sediments were a sink for O(2) (-14.47 +/- A 0.65 mol O(2) m(-2) y(-1)) and a source of DIC and NH(4) (+) (18.84 +/- A 2.80 mol DIC m(-2) y(-1) and 0.83 +/- A 0.16 mol NH(4) (+) m(-2) y(-1)), and dissipated nitrate via denitrification (1.44 +/- A 0.11 mol NO(3) (-) m(-2) y(-1)). Overall, nutrient uptake by primary producers and regeneration from sediments were a minor fraction of external loads. This work suggests that the creation of fluvial lakes can produce net autotrophic systems, with elevated rates of phytoplanktonic primary production, largely sustained by allochtonous nutrient inputs. These hypereutrophic aquatic bodies are net C sinks, although they simultaneously release CO(2) to the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Zooplankton spatial heterogeneity has profound effects on understanding and modelling of zooplankton population dynamics and interactions with other planktonic compartments, and consequently, on the structure and function of planktonic ecosystems. On the one hand, zooplankton heterogeneity at spatial and temporal scales of ecological interest is an important focus of aquatic ecology research because of its implications in models of productivity, herbivory, nutrient cycling and trophic interactions in planktonic ecosystems. On the other hand, estimating zooplankton spatial variation at the scale of an ecosystem, is a powerful tool to achieve accurate sampling design. This review concentrates on the spatial heterogeneity of marine and freshwater zooplankton with respect to scale. First to be examined are the concept of spatial heterogeneity, the sampling and statistical methods used to estimate zooplankton heterogeneity, and the scales at which marine and freshwater zooplankton heterogeneity occurs. Then, the most important abiotic and biotic processes driving zooplankton heterogeneity over a range of spatial scales are presented and illustrated by studies conducted over large and fine scales in both oceans and lakes. Coupling between abiotic and biotic processes is finally discussed in the context of the 'multiple driving forces hypothesis'. Studies of zooplankton spatial heterogeneity refer both to the quantification of the degree of heterogeneity ('measured heterogeneity') and to the estimation of the heterogeneity resulting from the interactions between the organisms and their environment ('functional heterogeneity') (Kolasa and Rollo, 1991). To resolve the problem of measuring zooplankton patchiness on a wide range of spatial scales, advanced technologies (acoustic devices, the Optical Plankton Counter (OPC), and video systems) have been developed and tested in marine and freshwater ecosystems. A comparison of their potential applications and limitations is presented. Furthermore, many statistical tools have been developed to estimate the degree of 'measured heterogeneity'; the three types most commonly used are indices of spatial aggregation, variance: mean ratio, and spatial analysis methods. The variance partitioning method proposed by Borcard et al. (1992) is presented as a promising tool to assess zooplankton 'functional heterogeneity'. Nested patchiness is a common feature of zooplankton communities and spatial heterogeneity occurs on a hierarchical continuum of scales in both marine and freshwater environments. Zooplankton patchiness is the product of many physical processes interacting with many biological processes. In marine systems, patterns of zooplankton patchiness at mega- to macro-scales are mostly linked to large advective vectorial processes whereas at coarse-, fine- and micro-scales, physical turbulence and migratory, reproductive and swarm behaviors act together to structure zooplankton distribution patterns. In freshwater environments, physical advective forces related to currents of various energy levels, and vertical stratification of lake interact with biological processes, especially with vertical migration, to structure zooplankton community over large to fine- and micro-scales. Henceforth, the zooplankton community must be perceived as a spatially well-structured and dynamic system that requires a combination of both abiotic and biotic explanatory factors for a better comprehension and more realistic and reliable predictions of its ecology.},

  abstract = {Effective management of coral reef ecosystems requires accurate, quantitative and spatially explicit information on patterns of species richness at spatial scales relevant to the management process. We combined empirical modelling techniques, remotely sensed data, field observations and GIS to develop a novel multi-scale approach for predicting fish species richness across a compositionally and topographically complex mosaic of marine habitat types in the U.S. Caribbean. First, the performance of three different modelling techniques (multiple linear regression, neural networks and regression trees) was compared using data from southwestern Puerto Rico and evaluated using multiple measures of predictive accuracy. Second, the best performing model was selected. Third, the generality of the best performing model was assessed through application to two geographically distinct coral reef ecosystems in the neighbouring U.S. Virgin Islands. Overall, regression trees outperformed multiple linear regression and neural networks. The best performing regression tree model of fish species richness (high, medium, low classes) in southwestern Puerto Rico exhibited an overall map accuracy of 75\%; 83.4\% when only high and low species richness areas were evaluated. In agreement with well recognised ecological relationships, areas of high fish species richness were predicted for the most bathymetrically complex areas with high mean rugosity and high bathymetric variance quantified at two different spatial extents (???0.01 km2). Water depth and the amount of seagrasses and hard-bottom habitat in the seascape were of secondary importance. This model also provided good predictions in two geographically distinct regions indicating a high level of generality in the habitat variables selected. Results indicated that accurate predictions of fish species richness could be achieved in future studies using remotely sensed measures of topographic complexity alone. This integration of empirical modelling techniques with spatial technologies provides an important new tool in support of ecosystem-based management for coral reef ecosystems. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The biogeochemical model is based on the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM) upgraded with a more detailed representation of the DOC-bacteria interactions and resolving different level of DOC lability/refractivity. The circulation model is the Adriatic Sea implementation of the Princeton Ocean Model. The analysis of simulations confirms the important role of the Po river nutrient input on the ecosystem dynamics and highlights the presence of a strong across-shelf trophic gradient that, affecting the Bacterial Growth Efficiency (BGE), could be a key factor for the DOC accumulation. The simulations show the importance of circulation features in modulating the exchanges between areas having different trophic structure such as the western coastal strip, strongly influenced by the Po river runoff, and the open sea areas in the centre of the northern Adriatic sub-basin. The DOC produced in the high energy system of the Po runoff coastal strip, characterized by high BGE, is transported toward the open areas, which is a more oligotrophic environment with lower BGE. In this area the DOC turnover time is strongly increased giving rise to the DOC accumulation.},

Seston and zooplankton were collected at 11 sampling sites located within distinct water masses discriminated according to their underwater spectral characteristics. Diffuse light attenuation coefficients (K-d(lambda)) varied among sampling sites and wavelengths (lambda) and were negatively correlated to seston composition in some essential fatty acids. Particularly, the relationships between K-d(lambda) and the seston concentration in 20:5n3 and 22:6n3 differed and were wavelength dependent, being stronger for lambda close to the absorption maxima of chlorophyll a, suggesting a potential link with photosynthetic processes. The concentrations of 16:1n7, 18:3n3 and 20:5n3 in copepods were strongly correlated to those in the seston, which points towards the trophic transfer of these fatty acids between primary producers and herbivorous consumers. Moreover, the growth condition of copepods, as expressed by their RNA:DNA ratio, was correlated to the concentrations of 16:1n7, 18:3n3 and 20:5n3 in the seston and in copepods. Our field study sheds light on the potential importance, yet to be precised, of specific wavelengths as a driver of Lac Saint-Pierre's productivity through their influence on fatty acids composition of seston and its nutritional quality for primary consumers.},

  abstract = {1. As rivers and streams are patchy and strongly hierarchical systems, a hierarchical patch dynamics perspective can be used as a framework for visualising interactions between structure and function in fluvial landscapes. The perspective is useful for addressing fundamental attributes of lotic ecosystems, such as heterogeneity, hierarchy, directionality and process feedback occurring across spatial scales and for illustrating spatio-temporal linkages between disparate concepts in lotic system ecology such as the River Continuum Concept, the Serial Discontinuity Concept, the Flood Pulse Concept and the Hyporheic Corridor Concept. 2. At coarse spatial scales, the hierarchical patch dynamics perspective describes each river network as a unique, patchy discontinuum from headwaters to mouth. The discontinuum is comprised of a longitudinal series of alternating stream segments with different geomorphological structures. Each confluence in the steam network further punctuates the discontinuum because the sudden change in stream characteristics can create a 'gap' in the expected pattern of downstream transitions. The discontinuum view recognises general trends in habitat characteristics along the longitudinal profile, but creates a framework for studying and understanding the ecological importance of each stream's individual pattern of habitat transitions along longitudinal, lateral or vertical vectors at any scale. 3. Object-oriented modelling and programming techniques provide a means for developing robust, quantitative simulation models that describe the dynamic structure of patch hierarchies. Such models can simulate how the structure and function of lotic ecosystems are influenced by the landscape context of the system (the ecological conditions within which the system is set) and the metastructure (structural characteristics and juxtaposition) of finer-scale patches comprising the system. 4. A simple object-oriented, multiscale, discontinuum model of solute transformation and biological response along a stream channel illustrates how changing the branching pattern of a stream and the arrangement of its component patches along the downstream profile will result in substantial changes in predicted patterns of solute concentration and biotic community structure. 5. The importance of context, structure, and metastructure in determining lotic ecosystem function serves to underscore Hynes' (1975) concept that 'every stream is likely to be individual! Advancing the discipline of fluvial landscape ecology provides an excellent opportunity to develop general concepts and tools that address the individual character of each stream network and integrate the concept of 'uniqueness within the river discontinuum' into our ecological understanding of rivers and streams.},

  abstract = {Until recently, the Arctic Basin was generally considered to be a low productivity area and was afforded little attention in global-or even basin-scale ecosystem modelling studies. Due to anthropogenic climate change however, the sea ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is undergoing an unexpectedly fast retreat, exposing increasingly large areas of the basin to sunlight. As indicated by existing Arctic phenomena such as ice-edge blooms, this decline in sea-ice is liable to encourage pronounced growth of phytoplankton in summer and poses pressing questions concerning the future of Arctic ecosystems. It thus provides a strong impetus to modelling of this region. The Arctic Ocean is an area where plankton productivity is heavily influenced by physical factors. As these factors are strongly responding to climate change, we analyse here the results from simulations of the 1/4 \textbullet{} resolution global ocean NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) model coupled with the MEDUSA (Model for Ecosystem Dynamics, carbon Utilisation, Sequestration and Acidification) biogeochemical model, with a particular focus on the Arctic basin. Simulated productivity is consistent with the limited observations for the Arctic, with significant production occurring both under the sea-ice and at the ther-mocline, locations that are difficult to sample in the field. Results also indicate that a substantial fraction of the variability in Arctic primary production can be explained by two key physical factors: (i) the maximum penetration of winter mixing, which determines the amount of nutrients available for summer primary production, and (ii) shortwave radiation at the ocean surface, which controls the magnitude of phytoplankton blooms. A strong empirical correlation was},

  abstract = {[1] As a part of Arctic Ocean Intercomparison Project, results from five coupled physical and biological ocean models were compared for the Arctic domain, defined here as north of 66.6\textdegree N. The global and regional (Arctic Ocean (AO)\textendash only) models included in the intercomparison show similar features in terms of the distribution of present-day water column\textendash integrated primary production and are broadly in agreement with in situ and satellite-derived data. However, the physical factors controlling this distribution differ between the models. The intercomparison between models finds substantial variation in the depth of winter mixing, one of the main mechanisms supplying inorganic nutrients over the majority of the AO. Although all models manifest similar level of light limitation owing to general agreement on the ice distribution, the amount of nutrients available for plankton utilization is different between models. Thus the participating models disagree on a fundamental question: which factor, light or nutrients, controls present-day Arctic productivity. These differences between models may not be detrimental in determining present-day AO primary production since both light and nutrient limitation are tightly coupled to the presence of sea ice. Essentially, as long as at least one of the two limiting factors is reproduced correctly, simulated total primary production will be close to that observed. However, if the retreat of Arctic sea ice continues into the future as expected, a decoupling between sea ice and nutrient limitation will occur, and the predictive capabilities of the models may potentially diminish unless more effort is spent on verifying the mechanisms of nutrient supply. Our study once again emphasizes the importance of a realistic representation of ocean physics, in particular vertical mixing, as a necessary foundation for ecosystem modeling and predictions.},

In each case, regardless of DOM composition, UV-vis absorption increased linearly with increasing iron(III). Correction factors were derived using iron(III) absorption coefficients determined at wavelengths commonly used to characterize DOM. Iron(III) addition increased specific UV absorbances (SUVA) and decreased the absorption ratios (E2:E3) and spectral slope ratios (SR) of DOM samples. Both iron(II) and iron(III) quenched DOM fluorescence at pH 6.7. The degree and region of fluorescence quenching varied with the iron:DOC concentration ratio, DOM composition, and pH. Regions of the fluorescence spectra associated with greater DOM conjugation were more susceptible to iron quenching, and DOM fluorescence indices were sensitive to the presence of both forms of iron.

Because lakes receive so much dissolved organic carbon from the terrestrial landscape, its accumulation in water bodies usually represents the largest pool of lacustrine organic matter within the water column. The transformation of even a small fraction of this external carbon by the microbial community can alter significantly the metabolic balance of lake ecosystems, simultaneously releasing carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and burying organic carbon in lake sediments. At the landscape level, even if they occupy a small fraction of the landscape, lakes play a surprisingly important role in the regional carbon budget, particularly when considered at the appropriate temporal scale.},

Measures of abundance, richness, and diversity of fishes were compared across nine habitat types in a lake using rapid visual underwater assessment. Multivariate analyses separated habitats into three groups and identified two distinct species assemblages. Most species were associated with macrophytes, but a few were primarily associated with rocky substrate. Shallow mud (open) habitats contained significantly fewer species and had lower mean scores and diversity than all other habitat types. Rocky habitats had lower mean scores and diversity than some vegetated habitat types containing similar fish assemblages. Surprisingly, within-site fish assemblage heterogeneity was similar to among-site heterogeneity, and among-habitat heterogeneity was lower than within-habitat heterogeneity, further supporting our inability to distinguish among vegetated habitat types. Our results suggest that habitat heterogeneity is critical in maintaining diverse communities and that compensation measures should account for differences in fish\textendash habitat associations among varied habitats.},

  abstract = {Conducting field samples for monitoring ecological dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales is a difficult task using standard protocols. One alternative is to measure a restricted set of variables which can serve as an ecological orientor (EO) for quantifying habitat change. The objective of this article is to derive from digital images a measure of structural complexity that may serve as a proximate EO for monitoring forest dynamics in space and time. The mean information gain (MIG) index was used as a measure of structural complexity in photographs taken directly in the field over the entire growing season. At a small scene extent, the complexity of light intensity variations in digital images was positively related to species richness. At larger scene extents, forest understorey and overstorey layers showed predictable ecological signatures in structural complexity. in general, intensity and chroma were the two color space components which yielded the greatest sensitivity to habitat change through time. Within the framework of a standardized photographic protocol, it seems therefore reasonable to consider MIG as a suitable EO for monitoring forest dynamics in both space and time. Our results support the idea that it is possible on one hand to adopt a more holistic view of ecological processes to gain, on the other hand, spatial and temporal degrees of freedom for testing multiple scale hypotheses in the field.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Shannon evenness, a measure of landscape composition, and spatial contagion, a measure of landscape configuration, within sixteen Canadian regions covering a gradient of land-uses and human disturbances: natural, semi-natural, urban, and agricultural. The agricultural regions showed generally lower variation in contagion and evenness and overall lower contagion values (smaller patches), leading to steeper contagion-evenness slopes than in the other region categories. In addition, the sampled agricultural regions were much more similar to each other than were the sampled regions within each of the other three region categories. These results indicate that the process of agricultural development (at least in western Canada) leads to a reduction in pattern variation and an alteration of the expected relationships among pattern metrics in agricultural regions. This possibility is supported by a neutral model of patch dynamics, suggesting that the characteristic scale of disturbances is a generic structuring process of landscape trajectories.},

However, lack of a clear conceptual and methodological framework has prevented the development of such approaches within the field of conservation biology. Our objective was to illustrate how Google Trends, a freely accessible web-crawling engine, can be used to track changes in timing of biological processes, spatial distribution of invasive species, and level of public awareness about key conservation issues. Google Trends returns the number of internet searches that were made for a keyword in a given region of the world over a defined period. Using data retrieved online for 13 countries, we exemplify how Google Trends can be used to study the timing of biological processes, such as the seasonal recurrence of pollen release or mosquito outbreaks across a latitudinal gradient. We mapped the spatial extent of results from Google Trends for 5 invasive species in the United States and found geographic patterns in invasions that are consistent with their coarse-grained distribution at state levels. From 2004 through 2012, Google Trends showed that the level of public interest and awareness about conservation issues related to ecosystem services, biodiversity, and climate change increased, decreased, and followed both trends, respectively. Finally, to further the development of research approaches at the interface of conservation biology, collective knowledge, and environmental management, we developed an algorithm that allows the rapid retrieval of Google Trends data.},

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between newly developed photographic measures of structural heterogeneity in digital images and plant species composition in the context of a long-term grassland experiment. MethodsWe tested a close-range photographic protocol using measures of structural heterogeneity in gray-tone images, namely mean information gain (MIG) and spatial anisotropy, to assess differences in the compositional (species richness) and functional characteristics (plant height and flowering) of 78 managed grassland communities. We also implemented a random placement model of community assembly to explore the links between our measures of structural complexity and the geometric pattern of plant communities. Important FindingsMIG and spatial anisotropy correlated with the growth and species richness of grassland communities. Simulations showed that structural heterogeneity in gray-tone digital images is a function of the size distribution and orientation pattern of plant modules. This easy, fast and non-destructive methodological approach could eventually serve to monitor the diversity and integrity of various ecosystems at different resolutions across space and time.},

The robustness of the procedures under heterogeneity and serial dependence is considered as well. An investigation of the efficiency of an estimator of the change-points is also presented. Conditional on these estimated change-points, least squares estimators of the means in Lombard's model are derived and their efficiency is carefully studied. The procedures are illustrated on two environmental data sets, namely the annual volume of discharge from the Nile River and the annual temperature anomalies for the northern hemisphere. It will be seen that Lombard's model is flexible, that the test statistics of Lombard (1987) are powerful, and that the proposed estimators have nice properties; hence Lombard's model has a high potential for applications in the environmental sciences.

Although phosphorus is considered the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton production in freshwater systems, the effects of atmospheric nitrogen and its contribution to acidification of fresh waters can be detrimental. Within the estuarine to coastal continuum, multiple nutrient limitations occur among nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon along the salinity gradient and by season, but nitrogen is generally considered the primary limiting nutrient for phytoplankton biomass accumulation. There are well-established, but nonlinear, positive relationships among nitrogen and phosphorus flux, phytoplankton primary production, and fisheries yield. There are thresholds, however, where the load of nutrients to estuarine, coastal and marine systems exceeds the capacity for assimilation of nutrient-enhanced production, and water-quality degradation occurs. Impacts can include noxious and toxic algal blooms, increased turbidity with a subsequent loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, oxygen deficiency, disruption of ecosystem functioning, loss of habitat, loss of biodiversity, shifts in food webs, and loss of harvestable fisheries.},

  abstract = {Biomass, inorganic carbon and nitrogen uptake, ammonium regeneration, nitrification, and vertical flux of particulate matter were measured in the equatorial Pacific at 21 daily productivity stations occupied on a meridional transect (150\textdegree W) between 1\textdegree N and 16\textdegree S. Three areas could be distinguished along the transect: (1) the equatorial area between 1\textdegree N and 6\textdegree S, where nitrate concentrations were typically eutrophic, reaching up to 3 {$\mu$}g-at L-1 in surface waters; (2) an intermediate mesotrophic area between 6\textdegree{} and 10\textdegree S, where surface nitrate concentrations decreased from 1 {$\mu$}g-at L-1 to zero; and (3) the oligotrophic area beyond 10\textdegree S, characterized by warm and nitrate poor waters. Although nitrate was the main form of inorganic nitrogen available for phytoplankton growth (70\%-100\% of total), its uptake was severely retarded in the equatorial sector. This lack of nitrate depletion in the equatorial sector between 0 and 6\textdegree S may in part result from the important ammonium supply (100 ng-at L-1 d-1) which could sustain up to 85\% of total inorganic nitrogen (nitrate + ammonium) utilization by phytoplankton. In addition, regenerated production also resulted from in situ nitrification (20-80 ng-atN L-1 d-1) which can fuel 20\%-100\% of the nitrate uptake. Sinking particles represented {$<$}10\% of total carbon fixation and {$\sim$}10\%-50\% of new production in terms of carbon and nitrogen. From these discrepancies it was suggested that (1) new production rates were overestimated because of the high level of nitrification that provided "regenerated nitrate" and (2) advection of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen played an important role in export. The specific hydrodynamical circulation, a conveyor belt generated by upwelling at the equator and downwelling some degrees south, associated with biological in situ remineralization of ammonium and nitrate as well, appeared to be a very efficient system for recycling inorganic nitrogen in the euphotic layer and thus for supporting the high regenerated production levels. On the other hand, the high nitrate/silicate ratios ({$>$}1.5) observed in the upwelling waters seemed to indicate that silicate is not efficiently recycled in this specific circulation system because of its low regeneration rate as well as its sink via rapidly sedimenting diatoms cell walls; this may be also true for iron. This reinforces the idea of Si and/or Fe limitation which was put forward earlier to explain low new production levels in the equatorial Pacific. Copyright 1999 by the American Geophysical Union.}

After oxidation, the concentration of the inorganic products dissolved in the sample was measured automatically by colorimetry using a 3-channel Technicon AutoAnalyzer system. A number of pure organic compounds were tested in the concentration range encountered in coastal and open ocean, indicating a high efficiency of the digestion procedure. The recovery range is similar to that obtained by other wet-oxidation procedures and by high-temperature catalytic oxidation techniques. Direct comparisons with usual methods used for separate determination of DOC, DON and DOP indicated a high efficiency of the procedure. Reproducibility tests demonstrated a very good precision (around 5\%) for lagoonal and coastal waters, while precision was sometimes around 10-25\% in oligotrophic oceanic waters, especially for DOP where values approached limits of detection for measuring phosphate.

One of the major objectives of the BIOSOPE cruise, carried out on the R/V Atalante from October-November 2004 in the South Pacific Ocean, was to establish productivity rates along a zonal section traversing the oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre (SPG). These results were then compared to measurements obtained from the nutrient \textendash{} replete waters in the Chilean upwelling and around the Marquesas Islands. A dual 13C/15N isotope technique was used to estimate the carbon fixation rates, inorganic nitrogen uptake (including dinitrogen fixation), ammonium (NH4) and nitrate (NO3) regeneration and release of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). The SPG exhibited the lowest primary production rates (0.15 g C m-2 d-1), while rates were 7 to 20 times higher around the Marquesas Islands and in the Chilean upwelling, respectively. In the very low productive area of the SPG, most of the primary production was sustained by active regeneration processes that fuelled up to 95\% of the biological nitrogen demand. Nitrification was active in the surface layer and often balanced the biological demand for nitrate, especially in the SPG. The percentage of nitrogen released as DON represented a large proportion of the inorganic nitrogen uptake (13\textendash 15\% in average), reaching 26\textendash 41\% in the SPG, where DON production played a major role in nitrogen cycling. Dinitrogen fixation was detectable over the whole study area; even in the Chilean upwelling, where rates as high as 3 nmoles l-1 d-1 were measured. In these nutrient-replete waters new production was very high (0.69{$\pm$}0.49 g C m-2 d-1) and essentially sustained by nitrate levels. In the SPG, dinitrogen fixation, although occurring at much lower daily rates ({$\approx$}1\textendash 2 nmoles l-1 d-1), sustained up to 100\% of the new production (0.008{$\pm$}0.007 g C m-2 d-1) which was two orders of magnitude lower than that measured in the upwelling. The annual N2-fixation of the South Pacific is estimated to 21\texttimes 1012g, of which 1.34\texttimes 1012g is for the SPG only. Even if our "snapshot" estimates of N2-fixation rates were lower than that expected from a recent ocean circulation model, these data confirm that the N-deficiency South Pacific Ocean would provide an ideal ecological niche for the proliferation of N2-fixers which are not yet identified.}

To explore the life of phytoplankton during and after the polar night, we used robotic ice-avoiding profiling floats to measure ocean optics and phytoplankton characteristics continuously through two annual cycles in Baffin Bay, an Arctic sea that is covered by ice for 7 months a year. We demonstrate that net phytoplankton growth occurred even under 100\% ice cover as early as February and that it resulted at least partly from photosynthesis. This highlights the adaptation of Arctic phytoplankton to extreme low-light conditions, which may be key to their survival before seeding the spring bloom.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In the frame of the BIOSOPE cruise in 2004, the spatial distribution and structure of phytoplankton pigments was investigated along a transect crossing the ultra-oligotrophic South Pacific Subtropical Gyre (SPSG) between the Marquesas Archipelago (141\textdegree{} W\textendash 8\textdegree{} S) and the Chilean upwelling (73\textdegree{} W\textendash 34\textdegree{} S). A High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method was improved in order to be able to accurately quantify pigments over such a large range of trophic levels, and especially from strongly oligotrophic conditions. Seven diagnostic pigments were associated to three phytoplankton size classes (pico-, nano and microphytoplankton). The total chlorophyll-{$\alpha$} concentrations [TChl{$\alpha$}] in surface waters were the lowest measured in the centre of the gyre, reaching 0.017 mg m-3. Pigment concentrations at the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) were generally 10 fold the surface values. Results were compared to predictions from a global parameterisation based on remotely sensed surface [TChl{$\alpha$}]. The agreement between the in situ and predicted data for such contrasting phytoplankton assemblages was generally good: throughout the oligotrophic gyre system, picophytoplankton (prochlorophytes and cyanophytes) and nanophytoplankton were the dominant classes. Relative bacteriochlorophyll-{$\alpha$} concentrations varied around 2\%. The transition zone between the Marquesas and the SPSG was also well predicted by the model. However, some regional characteristics have been observed where measured and modelled data differ. Amongst these features is the extreme depth of the DCM (180 m) towards the centre of the gyre, the presence of a deep nanoflagellate population beneath the DCM or the presence of a prochlorophyte-enriched population in the formation area of the high salinity South Pacific Tropical Water. A coastal site sampled in the eutrophic upwelling zone, characterised by recently upwelled water, was significantly and unusually enriched in picoeucaryotes, in contrast with an offshore upwelling site where a more typical senescent diatom population prevailed.}

This article reviews different techniques that can be used for each of these three subtasks and discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of each technique with references to theoretical and empirical studies. Further, recommendations are given to encourage best yet feasible practices in research and applications of machine learning. Common methods such as the holdout method for model evaluation and selection are covered, which are not recommended when working with small datasets. Different flavors of the bootstrap technique are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an alternative to confidence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is computationally feasible. Common cross-validation techniques such as leave-oneout cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation are reviewed, the bias-variance trade-off for choosing k is discussed, and practical tips for the optimal choice of k are given based on empirical evidence. Different statistical tests for algorithm comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed. Finally, alternative methods for algorithm selection, such as the combined F -test 5x2 crossvalidation and nested cross-validation, are recommended for comparing machine learning algorithms when datasets are small.},

Concentrations of DOC elevate significantly with increasing discharge in these rivers, causing approximately 60\% of the annual export to occur during a 2-month period following spring ice breakup. We present a total annual flux from the five rivers of {$\sim$}16 teragrams (Tg), and conservatively estimate that the total input of DOC to the Arctic Ocean is 25-36 Tg, which is {$\sim$}5-20\% greater than previous fluxes. These fluxes are also {$\sim$}2.5 \texttimes{} greater than temperate rivers with similar watershed sizes and water discharge. {$\Delta$}14C-DOC shows a clear relationship with hydrology. A small pool of DOC slightly depleted in {$\Delta$}14C is exported with base flow. The large pool exported with spring thaw is enriched in {$\Delta$}14C with respect to current-day atmospheric {$\Delta$}14C-CO2 values. A simple model predicts that {$\sim$}50\% of DOC exported during the arctic spring thaw is 1-5 years old, {$\sim$}25\% is 6-10 years in age, and 15\% is 11-20 years old. The dominant spring melt period, a historically undersampled period export a large amount of young and presumably semilabile DOC to the Arctic Ocean.

  abstract = {Advanced analytical techniques have revealed a high degree of complexity in the chemical makeup of dissolved organic matter (DOM). This has opened the door for a deeper understanding of the role of DOM in the aquatic environment. However, the expense, analytical cost, and challenges related to interpretation of the large datasets generated by these methods limit their widespread application. Optical methods, such as absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy are relatively inexpensive and easy to implement, but lack the detailed information available in more advanced methods. We were able to directly link the analysis of absorption spectra to the mass spectra of DOM using an in-line detector system coupled to multivariate data analysis. Monthly samples were taken from three river mouths in Sweden for one year. One subset of samples was exposed to photochemical degradation and another subset was exposed to long-term (4 months) biological degradation. A principle component analysis was performed on the coupled absorption-mass spectra data. Loading spectra for each principle component show distinct fingerprints for both reactivity (i.e. photochemical, biological degradation) and source (i.e. catchment land cover, temperature, hydrology). The fingerprints reveal mass-to-charge values that contribute to optical signals and characteristics seen in past studies, and emphasise the difficulties in interpreting changes in bulk CDOM characteristics resulting from multiple catchment processes. The approach provides a potential simple method for using optical indicators as tracers for more complex chemical processes both with regards to source material for DOM and the past reactive processing of DOM.},

In early winter the location of the boundary between undeformed fast ice and westward-drifting pack ice of the Pacific Gyre is controlled by major coastal promontories. Pronounced linear pressure- and shear-ridges, as well as hummock fields, form along this boundary and are stabilized by grounding, generally between the 10- and 20-m isobaths. Slippage along this boundary occurs intermittently at or seaward of the grounded ridges, forming new grounded ridges in a widening zone, the stamukhi zone, which by late winter extends out to the 40-m isobath. Between intermittent events along the stamukhi zone, pack-ice drift and slippage is continuous along the shelf edge, at average rates of 3-10 km/day. Whether slippage occurs along the stamukhi zone or along the shelf edge, it is restricted to a zone several hundred meters wide, and ice seaward of the slip face moves at uniform rates without discernible drag effects. A causal relationship is seen between the spatial distribution of major ice-ridge systems and offshore shoals downdrift of major coastal promontories. The shoals appear to have migrated shoreward under the influence of ice up to 400 m in the last 25 years. The sea floor seaward of these shoals within the stamukhi zone shows high ice-gouge density, large incision depths, and a high degree of disruption of internal sedimentary structures. The concentration of large ice ridges and our sea floor data in the stamukhi zone indicate that much of the available marine energy is expended here, while the inner shelf and coast, where the relatively undeformed fast ice grows, are sheltered. There is evidence that anomalies in the overall arctic shelf profile are related to sea-ice zonation, ice dynamics, and bottom processes. A proposed ice zonation, including zones of (1) bottom-fast ice, (2) floating fast ice, (3) stamukhi, and (4) seasonal pack ice, emphasizes ice interaction with the shelf surface and differs from previous zonation. Certain aspects of the results reported here are directly applicable to planned offshore developments in the Prudhoe Bay oil field. Properly placed artificial structures similar to offshore shoals should be able to withstand the forces of the ice, serve to modify the observed ice zonation, and might be used to make the environment less hostile to human activities. \textcopyright{} 1978.}

W) in the eastern Canadian Low Arctic, and in the Mackenzie River and adjacent Beaufort Sea in the western Canadian High Arctic (70?? N, 133?? W). Sampling was during ice-free open water conditions. Both rivers contained high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (3 and 6 mg DOC l-1 in the Great Whale River and Mackenzie River, respectively) and CDOM (a320 of 11 and 14 m-1), resulting in a substantial load of organic matter to their coastal seas. There were pronounced differences in the CDOM characteristics of the two rivers, notably in their synchronous fluorescence scans (SFS). The latter showed that the Mackenzie River was depleted in humic materials, implying a more mature catchment relative to the younger, more recently glaciated Great Whale River system. SFS spectra had a similar shape across the freshwater-saltwater transition zone of the Great Whale plume, and DOC was linearly related to salinity implying conservative mixing and no loss by flocculation or biological processes across the salt front. In contrast, there were major differences in SFS spectral shape from the Mackenzie River to the freshwater-influenced coastal ocean, with a marked decrease in the relative importance of fulvic and humic acid materials. The SFS spectra for the coastal Beaufort Sea in September-October strongly resembled those recorded for the Mackenzie River during the high discharge, CDOM-rich, snowmelt period in June, but with some loss of autochthonous materials. These results are consistent with differences in freshwater residence time between the Mackenzie River and Great Whale River coastal ocean systems. Models of arctic continental shelf responses to present and future climate regimes will need to consider these striking regional differences in the organic matter content, biogeochemistry and optics between waters from different catchments and different inshore hydrodynamic regimes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulated physical heterogeneity is most sensitive to the ratios of tributary to mainstream bed load flux and bed load grain size and is less sensitive to relative discharge. Within the model, aggradation drives the processes that augment habitat variability, and in general, any aggradational confluence will be associated with elevated physical diversity. Model output reveals elevated physical diversity at two scales: between distinctive upstream and downstream zones separated by a confluence step and within each zone as a function of local environmental gradients. Total diversity increases as tributary sediment load and caliber increase relative to the mainstream. The ecological implications of the patterns and magnitude of tributary-induced physical heterogeneity are considered, and testable hypotheses are presented. Results highlight the need to accurately characterise patterns of sediment production, delivery, and routing in order to predict local tributary impacts and thereby understand patterns of habitat diversity and biodiversity at network scales.},

Possible mechanisms include oscillating consumer-resource interactions, localized disturbance-recovery processes and scale-dependent feedback. Despite abundant theoretical literature, studies revealing spatial self-organization in real ecosystems are limited. Recently, however, many examples of regular pattern formation have been discovered, supporting the importance of scale-dependent feedback. Here, we review these studies, showing regular pattern formation to be a general phenomenon rather than a peculiarity. We provide a conceptual framework explaining how scale-dependent feedback determines regular pattern formation in ecosystems. More empirical studies are needed to better understand regular pattern formation in ecosystems, and how this affects the response of ecosystems to global environmental change. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Whereas the exudation of protein-like substances by healthy phytoplankton cells has been recognized, the in situ production of marine humic-like substances is still a matter of debate. Using axenic cultures, we demonstrate unequivocally that phytoplankton can directly contribute to the autochthonous production of colored humic-like substances in the ocean. Extrapolation of these findings to the field indicates that about 20\% of the marine humic-like substances produced in the highly productive coastal upwelling system of the Ria de Vigo could originate from growing phytoplankton. Therefore, the exudation of FDOM by marine phytoplankton should be considered in future studies of the dynamics of colored DOM in marine systems.},

Our main goal was to quantify and characterize the biotic and abiotic degradation processes that acted on sinking material during these periods. Diatoms, which dominated the phytoplanktonic assemblage in every trap sample, appeared to be remarkably sensitive to Type II (i.e. involving singlet oxygen) photodegradation processes in summer, but seemed to be relatively unaffected by biotic degradation at the same time. Hence, the relative recalcitrance of phytodetritus towards biodegradation processes during the Arctic midnight sun period was attributed to the strong photodegradation state of heterotrophic bacteria, which likely resulted from the efficient transfer of singlet oxygen from photodegraded phytoplanktonic cells to attached bacteria. In addition, the detection in trap samples of photoproducts specific to wax ester components found in herbivorous copepods demonstrated that zooplanktonic faecal material exported out of the euphotic zone in summer were affected by Type II photodegradation processes as well. By contrast, sinking particles collected during the autumn were not influenced by any light-driven stress. Further chemical analyses showed that photodegraded sinking particles contained an important amount of intact hydroperoxides, which could then induce a strong oxidative stress in underlying sediments. \textcopyright{} 2012 Author(s).}

  abstract = {Abstract. For the next decades significant climatic changes should occur in the Arctic zone. The expected destabilisation of permafrost and its consequences for hydrology and plant cover should increase the input of terrigenous carbon to coastal seas. Consequently, the relative importance of the fluxes of terrestrial and marine organic carbon to the seafloor will likely change, strongly impacting the preservation of organic carbon in Arctic marine sediments. Here, we investigated the lipid content of surface sediments collected on the Mackenzie basin in the Beaufort Sea. Particular attention was given to biotic and abiotic degradation products of sterols and monounsaturated fatty acids. By using sitosterol and campesterol degradation products as tracers of the degradation of terrestrial higher plant inputs and brassicasterol degradation products as tracers of degradation of phytoplanktonic organisms, it could be observed that autoxidation, photooxidation and biodegradation processes act much more intensively on higher plant debris than on phytoplanktonic organisms. Examination of oxidation products of monounsaturated fatty acids showed that photo- and autoxidation processes act more intensively on bacteria than on phytodetritus. Enhanced damages induced by singlet oxygen (transferred from senescent phytoplanktonic cells) in bacteria were attributed to the lack of an adapted antioxidant system in these microorganisms. The strong oxidative stress observed in the sampled sediments resulted in the production of significant amounts of epoxy acids and unusually high proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids with a trans double bond. The formation of epoxy acids was attributed to peroxygenases (enzymes playing a protective role against the deleterious effects of fatty acid hydroperoxides in vivo), while cis/trans isomerisation was probably induced by thiyl radicals produced during the reaction of thiols with hydroperoxides. Our results confirm the important role played by abiotic oxidative processes in the degradation of marine bacteria and do not support the generally expected refractory character of terrigenous material deposited in deltaic systems.}

  abstract = {Algorithms that have been used on a routine basis for remote sensing of the phytoplankton pigment, chlorophyll-a, from ocean colour data from satellite sensors such as th CZCS (Coastal Zone Color Scanner), Sea WiFS (Sea Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) and OCTS (Ocean Colour and Temperature Scanner) are all of an empirical nature. However, there exist theoretical models that allow ocean colour to be expressed as a function of the inherent optical properties of seawater, such as the absorption coefficient and the backscattering coefficient. These properties can in turn be expressed as functions of chlorophyll-a, at least for the so-called Case 1 waters in which phytoplankton may be considered to be the single, independent variable responsible for most of the variations in the marine optical properties. Here, we use such a theoretical approach to model variations in ocean colour as a function of chlorophyll-a concentration, and compare the results with some empirical models in routine use. The parameters of phytoplankton absorption necessary for the implementation of the ocean colour model are derived from our database of over 700 observations of phytoplankton absorption spectra and concurrent measurements of phytoplankton pigments by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) techniques. Since there are reports in the literature that significant differences exist in the performance of the algorithms in polar regions compared with lower latitudes, the model is first implemented using observations made at latitudes less than 50\textdegree. It is then applied to the Labrador Sea, a high-latitude environment. Our results show that there are indeed differences in the performance of the algorithm at high latitudes, and that these differences may be attributed to changes in the optical characteristics of phytoplankton that accompany changes in the taxonomic composition of their assemblages. The sensitivities of the model to assumptions made regarding absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (or yellow substances) and backscattering by particles are examined. The importance of Raman scattering on ocean colour and its influence on the algorithms are also investigated.},

The model includes a level 2.5 turbulent kinetic energy equation. A model simulation over 1997-1998 is verified against available data on sea ice, temperature, and salinity. The results demonstrate a consistent seasonal cycle in atmosphere-ocean exchanges and the formation and circulation of water masses and sea ice. The accuracy of radiative, momentum, and sensible heat exchanges at the sea surface, and the production of turbulent kinetic energy from winds and tides, are critical to the accuracy of the modeled circulation. The analysis of the mean error on near-surface temperature and salinity in the late summer and fall using standard bulk exchange coefficients and radiation (about 1degreesC too cold and 1 salinity unit too fresh) shows the tradeoff between tidal mixing at the head of the Laurentian Channel, and wind-driven circulation and mixing in the surface waters. The results suggest year-long stratification in the estuary and northwestern Gulf, with little mixing except near the head region, where relatively deep warmer waters are mixed to the surface during winter, and cold intermediate waters are efficiently withdrawn during summer. The results suggest that the summer cold waters found at intermediate depths in the estuary and northwestern Gulf are not formed in situ. A significant fraction of these waters enters through the Strait of Belle Isle in wintertime, eventually reaching the estuary within about 6 months.},

The permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) is the amplification of surface warming due to CO\textexclamdown inf\textquestiondown 2\textexclamdown/inf\textquestiondown{} and CH\textexclamdown inf\textquestiondown 4\textexclamdown/inf\textquestiondown{} emissions from thawing permafrost. An analysis of available estimates PCF strength and timing indicate 120{$\alpha$}85 Gt of carbon emissions from thawing permafrost by 2100. This is equivalent to 5.7{$\alpha$}4.0\% of total anthropogenic emissions for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario and would increase global temperatures by 0.29{$\alpha$}0.21 \textdegree C or 7.8{$\alpha$}5.7\%. For RCP4.5, the scenario closest to the 2 \textdegree C warming target for the climate change treaty, the range of cumulative emissions in 2100 from thawing permafrost decreases to between 27 and 100 Gt C with temperature increases between 0.05 and 0.15 \textdegree C, but the relative fraction of permafrost to total emissions increases to between 3\% and 11\%. Any substantial warming results in a committed, long-term carbon release from thawing permafrost with 60\% of emissions occurring after 2100, indicating that not accounting for permafrost emissions risks overshooting the 2 \textdegree C warming target. Climate projections in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and any emissions targets based on those projections, do not adequately account for emissions from thawing permafrost and the effects of the PCF on global climate. We recommend the IPCC commission a special assessment focusing on the PCF and its impact on global climate to supplement the AR5 in support of treaty negotiation.},

In this article we present an overview of the global permafrost C pool and of the processes that might transfer this C into the atmosphere, as well as the associated ecosystem changes that occur with thawing. We show that accounting for C stored deep in the permafrost more than doubles previous high-latitude inventory estimates, with this new estimate equivalent to twice the atmospheric C pool. The thawing of permafrost with warming occurs both gradually and catastrophically, exposing organic C to microbial decomposition. Other aspects of ecosystem dynamics can be altered by climate change along with thawing permafrost, such as growing season length, plant growth rates and species composition, and ecosystem energy exchange. However, these processes do not appear to be able to compensate for C release from thawing permafrost, making it likely that the net effect of widespread permafrost thawing will be a positive feedback to a warming climate. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Institute of Biological Sciences.},

No relationship was found between ag440 or s440 and salinity. Except in the southern Baltic, s440 was found to have a broad distribution (0.0165 {$\pm$} 0.0035), suggesting that it should be introduced as an additional variable in bio-optical models when ag440 is large. An alternative model for CDOM absorption was applied to available high quality UV-visible absorption spectra from the Wisla river (Poland). This model assumes that the CDOM absorption spectrum comprises distinct Gaussian absorption bands in the UV, similar to those of benzene. Five bands were fit to the data. The mean central energy of all bands was higher in early summer (E{\~ }7.2, 6.6, 6.4, 6.2 and 5.5 eV or 172, 188, 194, 200 and 226 nm) than in winter. The higher energy bands were found to decay in both height and width with increasing salinity, while lower energy bands broadened with increasing salinity. s440 was found to be correlated with shape parameters of the bands centred at 6.4 and 5.5 eV. While the exponential model is convenient for optical modelling and remote sensing applications, these results suggest that the Gaussian model offers a deeper understanding of chemical interactions affecting CDOM molecular structure.},

  abstract = {Coastal oceans link terrestrial and marine carbon cycles. Yet, carbon sources and sinks in these biomes remain poorly understood. Here, we explore the dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along the Amazon River-to-ocean continuum from the lower mainstem at \'Obidos to the open ocean of the western tropical North Atlantic. We molecularly characterized DOM via ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), determined DOM stable carbon isotopes, and interpreted the data in the context of bacterial abundance and production, phytoplankton biomass and composition. Multivariate analysis revealed that the DOM molecular variability in the plume was mainly influenced by the input of terrigenous DOM. Incubation experiments with water from close to the river mouth showed that photo- and bio-degradation preferentially removed 13C-depleted and 13C-enriched terrigenous DOM, respectively. However, there was no significant quantitative change in the total amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over five days. This result suggests that most of the reactive DOM had already been bio-degraded upstream within the river and that photo-degradation was diminished in the turbid plume close to the river mouth. Terrigenous DOM therefore appeared to be relatively non-reactive nearshore. In the less turbid offshore plume, enhanced light penetration stimulated growth of phytoplankton and increased bacterial production. Although marine DOM compounds became relatively enriched, bulk DOC concentrations were 9 to 30\% below levels expected from conservative mixing of river and ocean endmembers suggesting that quantitative removal of terrigenous DOM was not compensated by marine DOM production. We propose that removal of terrigenous DOM in the outer plume may be enhanced by (i) bio-degradation primed by reactive algal DOM, (ii) photo-degradation, which may further break down DOM into more bio-available forms, and possibly (iii) sorption of DOM to sinking particles.},

A new conceptual framework could help to reconcile the array of observed relationships. Using an exhaustive literature review, we test a conceptual framework proposing that the direction of environmental heterogeneity - biodiversity relationships is contingent on the level of human footprint to which an ecosystem is subjected (the anthropocline).

There was considerable consistency in the composition of the DOM between the two streams (unit mass resolution): {$>$}70\% of the masses detected occurred in both streams. Approximately 40-50\% of the bulk dissolved organic carbon in the stream water was bioavailable during a 12-d microbial decomposition experiment. ESI-MS compound level analysis identified which masses were used, which were not, and their patterns of utilization. In both streams, similar to40\% of the masses decreased in concentration, similar to55\% did not change, and {$<$}5\% increased. Despite the complex system ({$>$} 1,500 DOM compounds and a natural consortia of bacteria), there was a high degree of similarity in which masses were used and the amount of each mass used between replicate flasks for a stream. There was also good agreement between the two streams in which masses were used and the amount of each mass used. This suggests that the selection by the microbial consortia of organic compounds in the complex and heretofore largely uncharacterized DOM pool is repeatable and, therefore, ultimately predictable.},

  abstract = {This study aims to improve understanding of carbon cycling in the Buor-Khaya Bay (BKB) and adjacent part of the Laptev Sea by studying the inter-annual, seasonal, and meso-scale variability of carbon and related hydrological and biogeochemical parameters in the water, as well as factors controlling carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. Here we present data sets obtained on summer cruises and winter expeditions during 12 yr of investigation. Based on data analysis, we suggest that in the heterotrophic BKB area, input of terrestrially borne organic carbon (OC) varies seasonally and inter-annually and is largely determined by rates of coastal erosion and river discharge. Two different BKB sedimentation regimes were revealed: Type 1 (erosion accumulation) and Type 2 (accumulation). A Type 1 sedimentation regime occurs more often and is believed to be the quantitatively most important mechanism for suspended particular matter (SPM) and particulate organic carbon (POC) delivery to the BKB. The mean SPM concentration observed in the BKB under a Type 1 regime was one order of magnitude greater than the mean concentration of SPM ({$\sim$} 20 mg L-1) observed along the Lena River stream in summer 2003. Loadings of the BKB water column with particulate material vary by more than a factor of two between the two regimes. Higher partial pressure of CO2 (\textexclamdown i\textquestiondown p\textexclamdown/i\textquestiondown CO2), higher concentrations of nutrients, and lower levels of oxygen saturation were observed in the bottom water near the eroded coasts, implying that coastal erosion and subsequent oxidation of eroded organic matter (OM) rather than the Lena River serves as the predominant source of nutrients to the BKB. Atmospheric CO2 fluxes from the sea surface in the BKB vary from 1 to 95 mmol m-2 day-1 and are determined by specific features of hydrology and wind conditions, which change spatially, seasonally, and inter-annually. Mean values of CO2 emission from the shallow Laptev Sea were similar in September 1999 and 2005 (7.2 and 7.8 mmol m-2 day-1, respectively), while the CO2 efflux can be one order lower after a strong storm such as in September 2011. Atmospheric CO2 emissions from a thawed coastal ice complex in the BKB area varied from 9 to 439 mmol m-2 day-1, with the mean value ranged from 75.7 to 101 mmol m-2 day-1 in two years (September 2006 and 2009), suggesting that at the time of observations the eroded coastal area served as a more significant source of CO2 to the atmosphere than the tundra (mean value: 22.7 mmol m-2 day-1) on the neighboring Primorsky coastal plain (September 2006). The observed increase in the Lena River discharge since the 1990s suggests that increased levels of "satellite- derived" annual primary production could be explained by an increasing load of humic acids delivered to shelf water; in this water the color resulting from the presence of CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) mimics the color resulting from the presence of Chl \textexclamdown i\textquestiondown a\textexclamdown/i\textquestiondown{} when seen from space. Because the BKB area can be employed as an integrator of ongoing changes in the surrounding environment, we suggest that under ongoing changes, more nutrients, products of eroded OC transformation and river transport, will be delivered to the Arctic Ocean with its shrinking ice cover, potentially increasing primary production outside of the shallow East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). At the same time, because the ESAS is characterized by very low transparency which limits euphotic layer thickness, excessive \textexclamdown i\textquestiondown p\textexclamdown/i\textquestiondown CO2 will not be utilized by photosynthesis but will rather be emitted to the atmosphere at increasing rates, affecting regional CO2 balance. \textcopyright{} 2013 Author(s).}

The chromatographic behavior of a riverine and a coastal sample, compared with that of a solution of commercial humic acid, used as standard, shows a variation in the chromatographic signature to which corresponds a decrease in the apparent molecular weight (M-r). Also taking into account the solar radiation regime of the sample collection period, these data show the occurrence of a CDOM (chromophoric dissolved organic matter) fluorescence photobleaching just in the first few miles off the coast.},

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged from 3 to 10 mg C l-1 and CDOM levels (reported as a 305) ranged from 8 to 77 m-1 during April and July, 2007, when the LM system was experiencing very high freshwater inputs.

Our data indicate when Matagorda Bay waters photobleach; dissolved organic carbon utilization is enhanced perhaps due to enhanced microbial respiration of biologically labile photoproducts (BLPs). Net ecosystem metabolism calculations indicate that most of the LM system was net heterotrophic during our study. We estimate that BLP formation could support up to 20\% of the daily microbial respiratory C demand in LM surface waters and combined with direct photochemical oxygen consumption could have an important influence on O2 cycles in the LM system. \textcopyright{} 2009 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.},

The influence of the Mississippi River plume was clearly evident as CDOM levels (defined as a 305) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were well-correlated with salinity during all cruises. Elevated CDOM and CDOM:DOC ratios of surface samples collected offshore of Atchafalaya Bay and the Breton-Chandeleur Sound complex indicated emanations of organic-rich waters from coastal wetlands are also an important source to nearshore shelf waters. Generally, CDOM and DOC levels were highest in surface waters and decreased with depth, but during summer 2007 and summer 2008, CDOM levels in near-bottom samples were occasionally higher than at mid-depths without concomitant increases in DOC. CDOM photobleaching was measured during 24 irradiations using a SunTest XLS+ solar simulator with photobleaching rate coefficients (k 305) ranging from 0.011 to 0.32h -1. For fall 2007 and summer 2008, higher k 305 values were generally observed in samples with higher initial CDOM levels. However, samples collected during summer 2007 did not exhibit a similar pattern nor were there differences in photobleaching rates between surface and bottom samples. Spectral slope coefficients (S 275-295 or S 350-400) and DOC levels were largely unchanged after 24h irradiations. Modeled CDOM photobleaching for northern Gulf of Mexico mid-shelf waters predicts that during the summer when solar irradiance is high and the water column becomes stratified, nearly 90\% of the CDOM in the upper 1m may be lost to photobleaching, with losses up to 20\% possible even at 10m depth. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The main reason for measuring \{DOC\} has been to quantify the total DOM. The measurement focuses on ``dissolved'' organic matter with the assumption that particles can be removed by filtration through a micro-porous filter. Such filtration\textemdash essential in near shore waters\textemdash is often omitted in oceanic waters where the total organic matter is almost all ``dissolved.'' For over a century, there has been an interest in quantifying the pool of \{DOM\} in the sea and in other aquatic environments. Some of the early efforts included attempts to quantify ``humic substances'' and to measure colored material. Specific organic compounds have been measured and attempts have been made to understand origins and fates of these compounds for decades. While that type of research is possibly more interesting and fruitful\textemdash depending upon the questions asked\textemdash more energy has been expended overall to quantify the gross amount of DOM.},

High concentrations and yields of TDAA were also observed in the upper halocline of slope and basin waters, indicating off-shelf transport of bioavailable DOM from the Chukchi Sea. In contrast, concentrations and yields of TDAA in Beaufort surface waters were relatively low, indicting DOM was of limited bioavailability. Concentrations and yields of TDAA in the upper halocline of slope and basin waters were also low, suggesting the Beaufort is not a major source of bioavailable DOM to slope and basin waters.

The origins and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and bioavailable DOM were monitored during a long-term (2-year) study of groundwater in a fractured-rock aquifer in the Carolina slate belt. Surface precipitation was significantly correlated with groundwater concentrations of DOC, bioavailable DOM and chromophoric DOM, indicating strong hydrological connections between surface and ground waters. The physicochemical and biological processes shaping the concentrations and compositions of DOM during its passage through the soil column to the saturated zone are conceptualized in the regional chromatography model. The model provides a framework for linking hydrology with the processes affecting the transformation, remineralization and microbial production of DOM during passage through the soil column. Lignin-derived phenols were relatively depleted in groundwater DOM indicating substantial removal in the unsaturated zone, and optical properties of chromophoric DOM indicated lower molecular weight DOM in groundwater relative to surface water. The prevalence of glycine, {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid, and d-enantiomers of amino acids indicated the DOM was highly diagenetically altered. Bioassay experiments were used to establish DOC-normalized yields of amino acids as molecular indicators of DOM bioavailability in groundwater. A relatively small fraction (8 {$\pm$} 4 \%) of DOC in groundwater was bioavailable. The relatively high yields of specific d-enantiomers of amino acids indicated a substantial fraction (15\textendash 34 \%) of groundwater DOC was of bacterial origin.},

Samples were collected in the upper 150 m of the water column from the coast to 250 km offshore during 14 cruises from March 2001 to September 2003. During this period, a wide range of trophic states was encountered, from dense diatom blooms (chlorophyll-a concentrations up to 43 mu g l(-1)) at shelf stations during upwelling season (March-September) to lower chlorophyll-a concentrations (0.1-5 mu g l(-1)) during winter (November-February) and at basin stations ({$>$} 1700 m depth). We found only weakly positive relations of log total bacterial abundance to log chlorophyll-a concentration (as a proxy for availability of organic substrate), and of HNA bacteria as a fraction of total bacteria to log chlorophyll-a. Abundance of HNA and LNA bacteria co-varied positively in all regions, although HNA bacteria were more responsive to high phytoplankton biomass in shelf waters than in slope and basin waters. Since LNA cell abundance in general showed responses similar to those of HNA cell abundance to changes in phytoplankton biomass, our data do not support the hypothesis that HNA cells are the sole active component of marine bacterioplankton.

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors Limnology and Oceanography. Molecular size and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) distributions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seawater were determined qualitatively and quantitatively by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). To estimate the relationship between molecular size distribution and the DOC concentration of seawater DOM, seawater was desalinated with an electric dialyzer. The recent technological advancements of desalination make us possible to recover a high percentage of seawater DOM. Surface coastal seawater samples were collected from three locations in Japan: Tokyo Bay, Kashima Port, and Cape Inubo. Samples were evaluated by a chromatography system coupled with ultraviolet (UV) absorbance, fluorescence, and nondispersive infrared total organic carbon detectors in series. Two peaks, 1 (1.24 \texttimes{} 10 5 -1.54 \texttimes{} 10 5 Da) and 2 (9.48 \texttimes{} 10 2 -1.81 \texttimes{} 10 3 Da), were detected in all sample chromatograms. Peak 1 showed little fluorescence and UV absorption in all samples. It has been shown that carbohydrates, one of the main components of seawater DOM, exhibit almost no fluorescence or UV absorption; thus, Peak 1 could mainly consist of carbohydrates which are usually labile DOM. Total DOC concentrations of the Tokyo Bay, Kashima Port, and Cape Inubo were 1.38, 0.92, and 0.80 mg C L -1 , respectively. Peak 2 accounted for 75-80\% of the total DOC and showed a substantial humic-like fluorescence and UV absorption in all samples. These results indicate that the photochemical characteristics of seawater DOM significantly differ depending on its molecular size. Thus, analysis of molecular size with our HPSEC provides a new approach for quantitative and qualitative characterization of seawater DOM.},

The age of bulk DOC transiting the rivers of California's Central Valley is the oldest reported for large rivers and suggests wide-spread loss of soil organic matter caused by agriculture and urbaniza- tion. Using DAX 8 adsorbent, we isolated and measured 14C concentrations in hydrophobic acid fractions (HPOA); river samples showed evidence of bomb-pulse carbon with average D14C of 91 and 76\% for the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers, respectively, with older HPOA, -204\%, observed in agricultural drains. An operationally defined non- HPOA fraction of DOC was observed in the San Joaquin River with seasonally computed D14C values of between -275 and -687\%; the source of this aged material was hypothesized to be physically protected organic-matter in high clay-content soils and agrochemicals (i.e., radiocarbon-dead material) applied to farmlands. Mixing models suggest that the Sacramento River contributes about 50\% of the DOC load in the California State Water Project, and agricultural drains contribute approximately one-third of the load. In contrast to studies showing stabiliza- tion of soil carbon pools within one or two decades following land conversion, sustained loss of soil organic matter, occurring many decades after the initial agricultural-land conversion, was observed in California's Central Valley.},

  abstract = {Spectroscopic techniques and extracellular enzyme activity measurements were combined with assessments of bacterial secondary production (BSP) to elucidate flood-pulse-linked differences in carbon (C) sources and related microbial processes in a river-floodplain system near Vienna (Austria). Surface connection with the main channel significantly influenced the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in floodplain backwaters. The highest values of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) were observed during the peak of the flood, when DOC increased from 1.36 to 4.37 mg l(-1) and CDOM from 2.94 to 14.32 m(-1). The flood introduced DOC which consisted of more allochthonously-derived, aromatic compounds. Bacterial enzymatic activity, as a proxy to track the response to changes in DOM, indicated elevated utilization of imported allochthonous material. Based on the enzyme measurements, new parameters were calculated: metabolic effort and enzymatic indices (EEA 1 and EEA 2). During connection, bacterial glucosidase and protease activity were dominant, whereas during disconnected phases a switch to lignin degradation (phenol oxidase) occurred. The enzymatic activity analysis revealed that flooding mobilized reactive DOM, which then supported bacterial metabolism. No significant differences in overall BSP between the two phases were detected, indicating that heterogeneous sources of C sufficiently support BSP. The study demonstrates that floods are important for delivering DOM, which, despite its allochthonous origin, is reactive and can be effectively utilized by aquatic bacteria in this river-floodplain systems. The presence of active floodplains, characterized by hydrological connectivity with the main channel, creates the opportunity to process allochthonous DOC. This has potential consequences for carbon flux, enhancing C sequestration and mineralization processes in this river-floodplain system.},

  abstract = {Regional to global scale estimates of primary production must rely on remotely sensed quantities. Here, we characterize in situ light-primary production relationships and assess the predictive capability of several global primary production models using a 6-yr time series collected as part of the US JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS). The consistency and longevity of this data set provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate bio-optical modeling methodologies and their predictive capabilities for estimating rates of water-column-integrated primary production, SPP, for use with satellite ocean-color observations. We find that existing and regionally tuned parameterizations for vertically integrated chlorophyll content and euphotic zone depth do not explain much of the observed variability at this site. Fortunately, the use of these parameterizations for light availability and harvesting capacity has little influence upon modeled rates of SPP. Site-specific and previously published global models of primary production both perform poorly and account for less than 40\% of the variance in SPP. A sensitivity analysis is performed to demonstrate the importance of light-saturated rates of primary production, P*(sat), compared with other photophysiological parameters. This is because nearly one-half of SPP occurs under light-saturated conditions. Unfortunately, we were unable to derive a simple parameterization for P*(sat) that significantly improves prediction of SPP. The failure of global SPP models to encapsulate a major portion of the observed variance is due in part to the restricted range of SPP observations for this site. A similar result is found comparing global chlorophyll-reflectance algorithms to the present observations. More importantly, we demonstrate that there exists a time-scale (roughly 200 d) above which the modeled distributions of SPP are consistent with the observational data. By low-pass filtering the observed and modeled SPP time series, the model's predictive skill levels increase substantially. We believe that the assumptions of steady state and balanced growth used in bio-optical models of SPP are inconsistent with observational data. Most of the observed variance in SPP is driven by a variety of ecosystem disturbance processes that are simply not accounted for in bio-optical models. This puts important bounds on how SPP models should be developed, validated and applied. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {[1] Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), also referred to as gelbstoff, gilvin, or yellow matter, has long been known to be an important component of the optical properties of coastal and estuarine environments. However, an understanding of the processes regulating its global distribution and variability, its relationship to the total pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and its influence on light availability remain largely unexplored. Satellite imagery from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) is used to characterize the global distribution of light absorption due to colored detrital and dissolved materials (CDM). The quantity CDM is considered as it is not yet possible to differentiate CDOM and detrital particulate absorption from ocean color spectra on a routine basis. Nonetheless, analysis of an extensive field data set indicates that detrital particulates make only a small contribution to CDM. A comparison of coincident field observations of CDM with SeaWiFS retrievals shows good agreement, indicating that the present procedures perform well. To first order, the basin-scale CDM distribution reflects patterns of wind-driven vertical circulation of the gyres modulated by a meridional trend of increasing CDM toward higher latitudes. The global CDM distribution appears regulated by a coupling of biological, photochemical, and physical oceanographic processes all acting on a local scale, and greater than 50\% of blue light absorption is controlled by CDM. Significant differences in both CDM concentration and its contribution to blue light absorption are found spatially among the major ocean basins and temporally on variety of timescales. Significant impacts of riverine discharges can be discerned, although their effects are largely localized. Basin-scale distributions of CDM and DOC are largely unrelated, indicating that CDM is a small and highly variable fraction of the global DOC pool. This first view of the global CDM distribution opens many new doors for the quantification of global marine photoprocesses using satellite ocean color data.},

Detailed individual-based mathematical models on complex networks play an important role towards this aim. In this work, it is shown how one can exploit the Equation-Free approach and optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing to bridge detailed individual-based epidemic models with coarse-grained, system-level analysis within a pair-wise representation perspective. The proposed computational methodology provides a systematic approach for analyzing the parametric behavior of complex/multiscale epidemic simulators much more efficiently than simply simulating forward in time. It is shown how steady state and (if required) time-dependent computations, stability computations, as well as continuation and numerical bifurcation analysis can be performed in a straightforward manner. The approach is illustrated through a simple individual-based SIRS epidemic model deploying on a random regular connected graph. Using the individual-based simulator as a black box coarse-grained timestepper and with the aid of Simulated Annealing I compute the coarse-grained equilibrium bifurcation diagram and analyze the stability of the stationary states sidestepping the necessity of obtaining explicit closures at the macroscopic level.

  abstract = {Macrophyte net primary productivity (NPP) is a significant but understudied component of the carbon budget in large Amazonian floodplains. Annual NPP is determined by the interaction between stem elongation (vertical growth) and plant cover changes (horizontal expansion), each affected differently by flood duration and amplitude. Therefore, hydrological changes as predicted for the Amazon basin could result in significant changes in annual macrophyte NPP. This study investigates the responses of macrophyte horizontal expansion and vertical growth to flooding variability, and its possible effects on the contribution of macrophytes to the carbon budget of Amazonian floodplains. Monthly macrophyte cover was estimated using satellite imagery for the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 hydrological years, and biomass was measured in situ between 2003 and 2004. Regression models between macrophyte variables and river-stage data were used to build a semiempirical model of macrophyte NPP as a function of water level. Historical river-stage records (1970-2011) were used to simulate variations in NPP, as a function of annual flooding. Vertical growth varied by a factor of ca. 2 over the simulated years, whereas minimum and maximum annual cover varied by ca. 3.5 and 1.5, respectively. Results suggest that these processes act in opposite directions to determine macrophyte NPP, with larger sensitivity to changes in vertical growth, and thus maximum flooding levels. Years with uncommonly large flooding amplitude resulted in the highest NPP values, as both horizontal expansion and vertical growth were enhanced under these conditions. Over the simulated period, annual NPP varied by ca. 1.5 (1.06-1.63 TgC yr(-1) ). A small increasing trend in flooding amplitude, and by extension NPP, was observed for the studied period. Variability in growth rates caused by local biotic and abiotic factors, and the lack of knowledge on macrophyte physiological responses to extreme hydrological conditions remain the major sources of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The vertical spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient of K d is an important optical property related to the penetration and availability of light underwater, which is of fundamental interest in studies of ocean physics and biology. Models developed in the recent decades were mainly based on theoretical analyses and numerical (radiative transfer) simulations to estimate this property in optically deep waters, thus leaving inadequate knowledge of its variability at multiple depths and wavelengths, covering a wide range of solar incident geometry, in turbid coastal waters. In the present study, a new model is developed to quantify the vertical, spatial and temporal variability of K d at multiple wavelengths and to quantify its dependence with respect to solar incident geometry under differing sky conditions. Thus, the new model is derived as a function of inherent optical properties (IOPs \textendash{} absorption a and backscattering b b), solar zenith angle and depth parameters. The model results are rigorously evaluated using time-series and discrete in situ data from clear and turbid coastal waters. The K d values derived from the new model are found to agree with measured data within the mean relative error 0.02{\~ }6.24\% and R 2 0.94{\~ }0.99. By contrast, the existing models have large errors when applied to the same data sets. Statistical results of the new model for the vertical spectral distribution of K d in clear oceanic waters (for different solar zenith and in-water conditions) are also good when compared to those of the existing models. These results suggest that the new model can provide an improved interpretation about the variation of the vertical spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance, which will have important implications for ocean physics, biogeochemical cycles and underwater applications in both relatively clear and turbid coastal waters.

The circulation of the estuarine transition zone is driven by strong tides, a large river flow, and well-defined salinity gradients. For this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was applied to the estuarine transition zone of the St. Lawrence Estuary and used to examine stratification and density-driven baroclinic flow. The model was calibrated to field observations and subsequently predicted water level elevations, along-channel currents, and salinity with mean errors of less than 9\%, 11\%, and 17\%, respectively. The baroclinic density-driven currents were distinguished from the tidal barotropic currents by using principal component analysis. Stratification and baroclinic flow were observed to vary throughout the estuarine transition zone on tidal and subtidal spring-neap time scales. On a semidiurnal tidal time scale, stratification was periodic, and baroclinic flow was represented by pulses of sheared exchange flow, suggesting that neither buoyancy forcing nor turbulent mixing is dominant at this scale. On a subtidal spring-neap time scale, stratification and baroclinic flow varied inversely with tidal energy, increasing on weak neap tides and decreasing on strong spring tides.},

  abstract = {The bioreactivity or susceptibility of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to microbial degradation in streams and rivers is of critical importance to global change studies, but a comprehensive understanding of DOM bioreactivity has been elusive due, in part, to the stunningly diverse assemblages of organic molecules within DOM. We approach this problem by employing a range of techniques to characterize DOM as it flows through biofilm reactors: dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, excitation emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs), and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. The EEMs and mass spectral data were analyzed using a combination of multivariate statistical approaches. We found that 45\% of stream water DOC was biodegraded by microorganisms, including 31-45\% of the humic DOC. This bioreactive DOM separated into two different groups: (1) H/C centered at 1.5 with O/C 0.1-0.5 or (2) low H/C of 0.5-1.0 spanning O/C 0.2-0.7 that were positively correlated (Spearman ranking) with chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM, respectively). DOM that was more recalcitrant and resistant to microbial degradation aligned tightly in the center of the van Krevelen space (H/C 1.0-1.5, O/C 0.25-0.6) and negatively correlated (Spearman ranking) with CDOM and FDOM. These findings were supported further by principal component analysis and 2-D correlation analysis of the relative magnitudes of the mass spectral peaks assigned to molecular formulas. This study demonstrates that our approach of processing stream water through bioreactors followed by EEMs and FTICR-MS analyses, in combination with multivariate statistical analysis, allows for precise, robust characterization of compound bioreactivity and associated molecular level composition.},

  abstract = {1. With increases in river discharge over time and space, zooplankton generally encounter increased turbulence, turbidity, hydraulic forces, downstream advection and food limitations, all of which should affect species diversity and densities. Of these factors, the role of turbulence on the distribution of zooplankton is least known along longitudinal and lateral dimensions in river networks. 2. We tested the factorial effects of turbulence and grazing level on Ohio River potamoplankton in spring and summer using twelve 1600-L, outdoor mesocosms. Turbulence was calculated using the Froude number for equal depths but with current velocities of 0.064 and 0.32 m s(-1). Grazing levels corresponded to a high density treatment (=ambient river densities of rotifers, copepods and cladocerans) and a low density treatment (initially no zooplankton {$>$} 64 mu m). All tanks had the same water residence time, and hydraulic stress was minimized by circular flow patterns. 3. Zooplankton densities and population growth rates were significantly affected by turbulence level and season. In general, rotifer populations grew faster in high turbulence tanks (though Keratella and Brachionus populations flourished in both treatments in summer) and microcrustaceans thrived better in low turbulence environments. The larger, calanoid copepods handled more turbulent conditions much better than cyclopoids or nauplii. Zooplankton had no detectable effects on particulate organic carbon concentrations in either month (values were higher in spring), but rotifers reduced chlorophyll concentrations in both months. 4. The relative importance of turbulence in controlling potamoplankton is probably to vary not only on a longitudinal basis in river networks but also with both the hydrogeomorphic complexity of river reaches and the type and amount of river regulation. Plans for river rehabilitation and management should incorporate non-turbulent habitats in large rivers as a means of enhancing zooplankton populations and providing an important food web component for planktivores.},

The centrifugation method provides substantial savings in cost per sample as well as a reduction in the amount of radioactive waste generated. This method is preferable to the filtration method especially for large scale oceanographic programs involving extensive measurements of bacterial carbon production.

Rates of new production (uncorrected for effects of ice cover) averaged 3.08 mmol N m super(-2) d super(-1). Surface f ratios (the ratio between nitrate uptake and the total inorganic nitrate uptake) averaged 0.63, and depth-integrated f ratios equaled 0.69. It appeared that the water column in general was bilayered, in that f ratios were reduced near the surface in low (less than 2 mu M) nitrate waters and increased deeper in the euphotic zone. Ammonium concentrations and uptake were consistently low throughout the region. Growth rates were modest, with surface growth rates averaging 0.33 per day. A simple relationship among the attenuation of solar radiation by sea ice (and its associated snow cover and microbial community), the percentage of open water, ice thickness, water column attenuation, and phytoplankton photosynthesis is described. The relationship is nonlinear, but, in general, nutrient-replete water column photosynthesis are largely a function of the percentage of open water rather than ice thickness. Both irradiance and nutrient fields exert strong influences on phytoplankton productivity and ultimately result in a mosaic of biomass within the polynya.},

Bacterial growth, respiration, and growth efficiency were quantified in lake water dilution cultures performed in 20 lakes located in eastern Quebec, Canada, which varied with respect to both DOC and nutrient concentrations. Intrinsic growth rates of the bacteria ranged from 0.1 to 1.4 d(-1), bacterial cell-specific respiration rates ranged from 0.4 to 7.2 fg C cell(-1) h(-1), and growth efficiencies ranged from 6.7\% to 51.6\%. These variations were unrelated to bulk DOC concentrations. Instead, growth rate and efficiency were positively related to total phosphorus concentrations. Specific respiration rate, on the other hand, decreased with increasing phosphorus concentrations, and the magnitude of respiration, on a per-cell basis, strongly influenced observed growth efficiencies. In a series of substrate enrichment experiments, additions of glucose alone failed to stimulate a response in growth rate, mean cell biovolume, or the potential biomass yield in dilution cultures, but all responded positively to phosphorus additions. Our results show that bacterial metabolism and the fate of DOC input to take microbial communities are strongly dependent on phosphor-us availability, rather than total carbon availability. Extreme oligotrophy appears to place high respiratory demands on the bacterioplankton, resulting in very low bacterial growth efficiencies and consequently greater DOC flow to CO2 than to biomass available for transfer to higher trophic levels.},

  abstract = {By experimentally simulating the exposure of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) to sunlight during the mixing of river water and seawater in an estuary (St. Helena Sound, South Carolina), this study examined how photochemical alterations may affect both the magnitude and fate of DOM utilization by estuarine bacteria. In a series of experiments performed with water samples collected from 3 blackwater rivers draining into an estuary of the South Atlantic Bight (USA), exposure to light resulted in significant decreases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOM absorption at 350 nm relative to dark controls. When these water samples were subsequently inoculated with an estuarine bacterial community, prior exposure to light significantly increased bacterial growth, respiration and total DOC consumption relative to that observed in control treatments. Increases in respiration (46 to 78\%) were, however, always greater than increases in growth (19 to 35\%). This resulted in decreases in bacterial growth efficiency that ranged from 16 to 33\% and appeared predictable from initial differences in DOM optical characteristics. In addition, although light exposure consistently resulted in significant NH4 production, bacterial metabolism in light treatments was accompanied by a significant increase in bacterial demand for inorganic nutrients (117 to 243\% over dark controls). These results indicate that irradiation of terrigenous DOM significantly alters its ultimate fate (CO2 VS. bacterial biomass) and that bacterial carbon metabolism of photoaltered DOM is coupled to an enhanced demand for inorganic nutrients, which may considerably influence ecosystem-scale carbon and nutrient interactions in the coastal zone.},

Range-diversity plots are mathematically constrained by the lines of maximum and minimum mean covariance in species composition. We show how regions in the range-diversity plot corresponding to the line of maximum covariance correspond to large continental masses, and regions near the lower limit of the range-diversity plot correspond to archipelagos and mountain ranges. We show how curves of constant covariance correspond to nested faunas. Finally, we show that the observed distribution of the covariance range has significantly longer tails than random, with clear geographic correspondences. At the scale of our data we found that range-diversity plots reveal biodiversity patterns that cannot be replicated by null models, and correspond to conspicuous terrain features and taxonomic groupings.},

The chemical analyses and biotic measurements included inorganic nutrients, pigment signatures, particulate and dissolved organic species, bacterial production, and community res- piration. The biodegradability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was investigated with in vitro decomposition experiments. The net particulate organic carbon (POC) production was 50\% of the total organic production during the initial 6 d of nutrient-replete growth and during a major diatom bloom. In all other situations the carbon partitioning was strongly in favor of DOC, which accounted for 82 to 111\% of the total production. The production of new DOC preceded new DON by about 1 week. Thus, the new dissolved organic matter (DOM) initially had an infinite C:N ratio, which fell to 11\textendash 20 when DON started to accumulate. The highest C:N ratio was measured during a nutrient- replete diatom bloom. Dissolved polysaccharides accounted for 50 to 70\% of the new DOC, and the lowest relative amount was produced during a diatom bloom. The chemical analyses unequivocally demonstrated that carbon partitioning in favor of carbon-rich DOM can take place during an active diatom bloom and not only during the decay of a bloom. The DOC-producing mechanisms cannot be fully identified. However, during the different growth phases the DOC production varied, as did the speciation of DOM with respect to the C:N ratios. When net production of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was detected after 11 d, the DON production accounted for 25 to 50\% of the daily added and assimilated inorganic nitrogen. The measurements of community respiration made it possible to calculate the maximum carbon recycling by bacteria and bacterial net DOC assimilation. These calcu- lations showed the estimates of carbon partitioning to be very sensitive to bacterial growth yield values and the factors used to convert leucine and thymidine isotope incorporation to bacterial production. Decomposition experiments showed that at least 35\% of the new DOC was biodegradable over 10\textendash 12 d and that inorganic nutrients only marginally affected use. The calculated turnover times of new DOC were between 15 and 25 d. The semilabile nature of new DOC with respect to microbial attack is suggested as the main reason for the medium-term accumulation of new DOC.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Spectrally resolved efficiency (i.e. apparent quantum yield, AQY) of carbon monoxide (CO) photoproduction is a useful indicator of substrate photoreactivity and a crucial parameter for modeling CO photoproduction rates in the water column. Recent evidence has suggested that CO photoproduction from particles in marine waters is significant compared to the well-known CO production from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) photodegradation. Although CDOM-based CO AQY spectra have been extensively determined, little is known of this information on the particulate phase. Using water samples collected from the Mackenzie estuary, shelf, and Canada Basin in the southeastern Beaufort Sea, the present study for the first time quantified the AQY spectra of particle-based CO photoproduction and compared them with the concomitantly determined CDOM-based CO AQY spectra. CO AQYs of both particles and CDOM decreased with wavelength but the spectral shape of the particulate AQY was flatter in the visible regime. This feature resulted in a disproportionally higher visible light-driven CO production by particles, thereby increasing the ratio of particle- to CDOM-based CO photoproduction with depth in the euphotic zone. In terms of depth-integrated production in the euphotic zone, CO formation from CDOM was dominated by the ultraviolet (UV, 290\textendash 400 nm) radiation whereas UV and visible light played roughly equal roles in CO production from particles. Spatially, CO AQY of bulk particulate matter (i.e. the sum of organics and inorganics) augmented from the estuary and shelf to the basin while CO AQY of CDOM trended inversely. Water from the deep chlorophyll maximum layer revealed higher CO AQYs than did surface water for both particles and CDOM. CO AQY of bulk particulate matter exceeded that of CDOM on the shelf and in the basin, but the sequence reversed in the estuary. Without consideration of the potential role of metal oxides (e.g. iron oxides) in particle photochemistry, mineral absorption-corrected CO AQY of particulate organic matter (POM) could, however, surpass its CDOM counterpart in all three sub-regions and displayed magnitudes in the estuary that overtook those in shelf and offshore waters. In terms of CO photoproduction, POM was thus more photoreactive than CDOM, irrespective of the organic matter's origins (i.e. terrigenous or marine). Riverine CDOM exhibited higher photoreactivity than marine CDOM and land-derived POM appeared more photoreactive than marine POM. AQY-based modeling indicates that CO photoproduction in the study area is underestimated by 12\textendash 32\% if the particulate term is ignored.}

  abstract = {Although there are considerable site-based data for individual or groups of ecosystems, these datasets are widely scattered, have different data formats and conventions, and often have limited accessibility. At the broader scale, national datasets exist for a large number of geospatial features of land, water, and air that are needed to fully understand variation among these ecosystems. However, such datasets originate from different sources and have different spatial and temporal resolutions. By taking an open-science perspective and by combining site-based ecosystem datasets and national geospatial datasets, science gains the ability to ask important research questions related to grand environmental challenges that operate at broad scales. Documentation of such complicated database integration efforts, through peer-reviewed papers, is recommended to foster reproducibility and future use of the integrated database. Here, we describe the major steps, challenges, and considerations in building an integrated database of lake ecosystems, called LAGOS (LAke multi-scaled GeOSpatial and temporal database), that was developed at the sub-continental study extent of 17 US states (1,800,000 km(2)). LAGOS includes two modules: LAGOSGEO, with geospatial data on every lake with surface area larger than 4 ha in the study extent ({\~ }50,000 lakes), including climate, atmospheric deposition, land use/cover, hydrology, geology, and topography measured across a range of spatial and temporal extents; and LAGOSLIMNO, with lake water quality data compiled from {\~ }100 individual datasets for a subset of lakes in the study extent ({\~ }10,000 lakes). Procedures for the integration of datasets included: creating a flexible database design; authoring and integrating metadata; documenting data provenance; quantifying spatial measures of geographic data; quality-controlling integrated and derived data; and extensively documenting the database. Our procedures make a large, complex, and integrated database reproducible and extensible, allowing users to ask new research questions with the existing database or through the addition of new data. The largest challenge of this task was the heterogeneity of the data, formats, and metadata. Many steps of data integration need manual input from experts in diverse fields, requiring close collaboration.},

The effects of various storage methods for particles collected on glass-fiber filters were examined using natural marine particles. Sensitivity to storage effects differed for particles collected from different environments, but results consistently indicated that refrigeration for more than a few hours and freezing at -10\textdegree C are inadequate for preserving absorption by phytoplankton pigments in the visible region of the spectrum. Storage at -80\textdegree C and at liquid-nitrogen temperatures was found to be satisfactory, with liquid nitrogen providing the most reliable results for the longest periods evaluated (up to 1 yr). Increases in absorption were observed at ultraviolet wavelengths under all storage conditions, which suggests that optical properties in this region of the spectrum cannot be reliably assessed unless samples are analyzed immediately after collection.}

To address the challenge for automated taxonomic identification of images generated by our custom- built submersible Imaging FlowCytobot, we developed an approach that relies on extraction of image features, which are then presented to a machine learning algorithm for classification. Our approach uses a combination of image feature types including size, shape, symmetry, and texture characteristics, plus orientation invariant moments, diffraction pattern sampling, and co- occurrence matrix statistics. Some of these features required preprocessing with image analysis techniques including edge detection after phase congruency calculations, morphological operations, boundary representation and simplification, and rotation. For the machine learning strategy, we developed an approach that combines a feature selection algorithm and use of a support vector machine specified with a rigorous parameter selection and training approach. After training, a 22- category classifier provides 88\% overall accuracy for an independent test set, with individual category accuracies ranging from 68\% to 99\%. We demonstrate application of this classifier to a nearly uninterrupted 2- month time series of images acquired in Woods Hole Harbor, including use of statistical error correction to derive quantitative concentration estimates, which are shown to be unbiased with respect to manual estimates for random subsamples. Our approach, which provides taxonomically resolved estimates of phytoplankton abundance with fine temporal resolution ( hours for many species), permits access to scales of variability from tidal to seasonal and longer.}

  abstract = {The ability to distinguish water inputs from both natural and anthropogenic sources was investigated in the complex environment of an urban estuary (Tyne) and a relatively pristine estuary (Tweed). We used a data set from a total of 11 estuarine transects, comprising measurements of bulk dissolved organic matter (dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen), dissolved nitrogen (total dissolved nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate + nitrite and dissolved organic nitrogen), optical absorbance measurements (a350, S290-350) and fluorescence excitation emission matrix measurements (fluorophores A, H, B and T intensity and A and H emission wavelength maxima). In order to investigate trends within the numerous parameters measured, multivariate statistics were employed. Principal components analyses showed 63.4\% of the variability in the total data set can be explained by two sets of components and 74.9\% of the variability by the spectrophotometric measurements alone. In both analyses the first component correlated to the mixing of terrestrial and marine waters and the second component was correlated to sources of pollution such as domestic sewage. Within the data set, river flow and terrestrially derived DOM were significantly correlated, and situations with high river input showed an increase in terrestrial signature in the estuary. Discriminant analyses were also carried out and indicated that 59.8\% (total data set) and 53.3\% (solely spectrophotometric data) of the samples can be correctly classified into their respective groups (water categories) assigned on the basis of salinity and sampling location. Overall the results clearly show the potential of spectrophotometric techniques to discriminate distinct water categories with different DOM characteristics. In particular, measurement of the fluorophore H emission maxima, the spectral slope parameter, S290-350, and fluorophores T and B intensity enabled discrimination of DOM from riverine, estuarine, marine, and sewage affected water categories. The results presented here indicate the ability of spectrophotometric data alone to distinguish between marine, anthropogenic and terrestrial DOM and distinguish terrestrial DOM from different catchments (Tyne vs. Tweed). With current advances in the in-situ deployment of absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy it is anticipated that multivariate statistics will gain importance as a cost effective, powerful and diagnostic approach to assessing the distributions of water types and their associated DOM characteristics and fluxes at the land-ocean interface. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Photochemical degradation of Congo River dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated to examine the fate of terrigenous DOM derived from tropical ecosystems. Tropical riverine DOM receives greater exposure to solar radiation, particularly in large river plumes discharging directly into the open ocean. Initial Congo River DOM exhibited dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and compositional characteristics typical of organic rich blackwater systems. During a 57 day irradiation experiment, Congo River DOM was shown to be highly photoreactive with a decrease in DOC, chromophoric DOM (CDOM), lignin phenol concentrations (Sigma(8)) and carbon-normalized yields (Lambda(8)), equivalent to losses of similar to 45, 85-95, {$>$}95 and {$>$}95\% of initial values, respectively, and a +3.1 parts per thousand enrichment of the delta C-13-DOC signature. The loss of Lambda(8) and enrichment of delta C-13-DOC during irradiation was strongly correlated (r = 0.99, p {$<$} 0.01) indicating tight coupling between these biomarkers. Furthermore, the loss of CDOM absorbance was correlated to the loss of Lambda(8) (e.g., a(355) versus Lambda(8); r = 0.98, p {$<$} 0.01) and delta C-13-DOC (e.g., a(355) versus delta C-13; r = 0.97, p {$<$} 0.01), highlighting the potential of CDOM absorbance measurements for delineating the photochemical degradation of lignin and thus terrigenous DOM. It is apparent that these commonly used measurements for examination of terrigenous DOM in the oceans have a higher rate of photochemical decay than the bulk DOC pool. Further process-based studies are required to determine the selective removal rates of these biomarkers for advancement of our understanding of the fate of this material in the ocean.},

Relationships between CDOM absorption at a range of wavelengths (a254, a350, a440) and DOC in the 30 watersheds were found to correlate strongly and positively for the majority of U.S. rivers. However, four rivers (Colorado, Colombia, Rio Grande and St. Lawrence) exhibited statistically weak relationships between CDOM absorption and DOC. These four rivers are atypical, as they either drain from the Great Lakes or experience significant impoundment of water within their watersheds, and they exhibited values for dissolved organic matter (DOM) parameters indicative of autochthonous or anthropogenic sources or photochemically degraded allochthonous DOM and thus a decoupling between CDOM and DOC. CDOM quality parameters in the 30 rivers were found to be strongly correlated to DOM compositional metrics derived via XAD fractionation, highlighting the potential for examining DOM biochemical quality from CDOM measurements. This study establishes the ability to derive DOC concentration from CDOM absorption for the majority of U.S. rivers, describes characteristics of riverine systems where such an approach is not valid, and emphasizes the possibility of examining DOM composition and thus biogeochemical function via CDOM parameters. Therefore, the usefulness of CDOM measurements, both laboratory-based analyses and in situ instrumentation, for improving spatial and temporal resolution of DOC fluxes and DOM dynamics in future studies is considerable in a range of biogeochemical studies.},

Second, a new algorithm enables estimation of sea ice concentration from the channels near 90 GHz, despite the enhanced atmospheric influence in these channels. This allows full exploitation of their horizontal resolution, which is up to 4 times finer than that of the channels near 19 and 37 GHz, the frequencies used by the most widespread algorithms for sea ice retrieval, the NASA-Team and Bootstrap algorithms. The ASI algorithm used combines a model for retrieving the sea ice concentration from SSM/I 85-GHz data proposed by Svendsen et al. (1987) with an ocean mask derived from the 18-, 23-, and 37-GHz AMSR-E data using weather filters. During two ship campaigns, the correlation of ASI, NASA-Team 2, and Bootstrap algorithms ice concentrations with bridge observations were 0.80, 0.79, and 0.81, respectively. Systematic differences over the complete AMSR-E period (2002\textendash 2006) between ASI and NASA-Team 2 are below -2 {$\pm$} 8.8\%, and between ASI and Bootstrap are 1.7 {$\pm$} 10.8\%. Among the geophysical implications of the ASI algorithm are: (1) Its higher spatial resolution allows better estimation of crucial variables in numerical atmospheric and ocean models, for example, the heat flux between ocean and atmosphere, especially near coastlines and in polynyas. (2) It provides an additional time series of ice area and extent for climate studies.},

Significant changes were observed for all species in their cellular nutrient content, pigment packaging and composition, and ch1 a-specific in vivo light absorption (a*(ch1a)(lambda)). From exponential to stationary growth, the C:N and carotenoid:chl a ratios increased, while the cellular ch1 a content decreased. All phytoplankton species acclimated to increasing irradiance by reducing their cellular ch1 a content and increasing the carotenoid:chl a ratio, resulting in higher ch1 a-specific absorption coefficients (a*(ch1a)). Similar results were observed for N-depleted cultures. Although acclimation to different irradiance and nutrient conditions introduced a substantial variability in pigment composition and intracellular pigment concentration, significant interspecies differences in a*(ch1a) were still apparent. The interspecies differences were primarily due to differences in cell size, which covaried with pigment packaging and composition. On this basis, we suggest that optical acclimation (i.e. changes in pigment composition and packaging) to the prevailing growth conditions (light, temperature and nutrient availability) is less important than differences in phytoplankton composition (dominant cell size and pigment composition) for the variation in a*(ch1a)(lambda) of natural phytoplankton communities.},

A power model on In-transformed data provided the best model fit compared to a power model on non-transformed data previously applied to parameterize the relationship between a*(ph) (lambda) and [Chila]. The variation in a*(ph) (lambda) was parameterized over four orders of magnitude in [Chl a] (0.01-100 mg Chlam- 3) producing a 13-fold range in a*(ph) (0.19 to 0.015 m(2) mg(-1) Chl a) at 440 nm, the peak absorption of Chl a in the blue part of the spectrum. The variations in the modelled a*(ph) spectra were within realistic predictions of a*(ph) (;,) and the model satisfactorily reproduced the spectral flattening with increasing [Chla]. The parameterization of a*(ph) (lambda) confirmed the indirect dependency of a*(ph) (lambda) on [Chla] through co-variations between [Chla] with pigment packaging and pigment composition. Although pigment packaging determined the spectral flattening, analysis of absorption ratios revealed a systematic change in pigment composition with profound influence on the variability of a*ph in the 440 to 495 nm region. Modelled spectra deviated by approximately 20\% from the measured spectra on average and model accuracy was independent of [Chl a]. Although the model cannot fully replace spectral measurements of phytoplankton absorption, it does permit realistic reconstructions of a*(ph) (lambda) from simple measurements of [Chl a] sampled in estuarine, coastal and oceanic waters.},

  abstract = {Although community structure may be largely determined by local abiotic and biotic conditions under moderate levels of dispersal, anthropogenic activities can enhance dispersal rates far beyond what would otherwise occur in natural systems. We investigated the potential impact of recreational canoeing on crustacean zooplankton community structure in Killarney Provincial Park, Canada, where canoes that are transported between lakes via portage routes may enhance zooplankton community connectivity by providing a dispersal "short-cut." We conducted a study to (1) quantify zooplankton attachment to canoe hulls after paddling through a lake and assess the importance of canoes to overall seasonal dispersal within a lake relative to other means of dispersal, (2) test the prediction that zooplankton survivorship is negatively correlated with portage duration using a mesocosm experiment, and (3) test whether variation in lake community composition was better explained by models based on reduced portage-corrected distances or true edge-to-edge distances between lakes along popular canoe routes. Here, we report the findings that canoes have the potential to act as frequent dispersal vectors, but appear to have little impact on community structure in portage-connected lakes. Substantial numbers of adult zooplankton became attached to canoe hulls and were able to establish viable populations even after exposure to portage conditions for 30 min. However, canoe-mediated dispersal only accounted for a very small proportion ({$<$} 1\% in this case) of overall seasonal dispersal. Moreover, environmental variables explained the greatest amount of variation in community composition among park lakes. Nevertheless, this study indicates that canoe dispersal could be more effective for specific species such as Sida crystallina than is evident by analysis of entire communities and could facilitate the spread of invasive species amenable to attaching to boat hulls. Thus, the debate about whether community composition is more strongly influenced by local environmental conditions or regional dispersal may vary depending on the scale of consideration (i.e., individual species vs. whole community).},

With LDA measurement of flow can be done nearly punctually without any mechanical disturbance. Mapping the current velocities around the body of Ecdyonurus cf. venosus (Insecta, Ephemeroptera) and Ancylus fluviatilis (Gastropoda) gives evidence that boundary layer separation occurs above the animals' bodies. Our results indicate that the velocities around the body of benthic stream invertebrates and probably the forces acting on them are much more complicate than is suggested by the currently accepted boundary layer concept.},

This work presents the results from a modelling exercise, laboratory experiment and field data, which describe the variations in the optical properties of CDOM during mixing. The exponential slope coefficient (S) is frequently used to characterise different CDOM pools; however, its behaviour during conservative mixing of two different CDOM types is often misunderstood. Identification of a theoretical conservative mixing line allows the rapid identification of non-conservative processes (e.g. in situ production, flocculation and degradation) acting on the pool during mixing. The results suggest that some of the patterns reported in the literature could purely be a result of conservative mixing rather than a product of non-conservative processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The results reveal that at least five different fluorescent DOM fractions present (in significant amounts) in the catchment and that the relative composition is dependent on the source (e.g. agricultural runoff, forest soil, aquatic production). Four different allochthonous fluorescent groups and one autochthonous fluorescent group were identified. The ability to trace the different fractions of the DOM pool using this relatively cheap and fast technique represents a significant advance within the fields of aquatic ecology and chemistry, and will prove to be useful for catchment management.

Seasonal patterns in the concentrations of DOM in the freshwater supply to the estuary differed depending on the soil and drainage characteristics of the area. In streams draining more natural areas the, patterns observed were largely driven by seasonal temperature fluctuations. The material exported from agricultural areas was more variable and largely controlled by precipitation events. Positive exponential relationships were found between the nitrogen and phosphorus loading, and the percentage of catchment area used for agriculture. Colored DOM (CDOM) loading measurements were found to be a good predictor of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loading across the different subcatchments, offering a rapid and inexpensive alternative of operationally monitoring DOC export. For all the dissolved nutrient inputs to the estuary, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved organic phosphorus dominated the loadings. Although 81\% of the nitrogen annually supplied to the estuary was DIN, 83\% of the nitrogen exported from the estuary was dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Results show that increasing the area of the catchment covered by forest and natural pastures would have a positive effect on the trophic status of the estuary, leading to a considerable decrease in the phosphorus loading and a shift in the nitrogen loading from DIN to DON. Such a change in land use would also increase the export of DOC and CDOM to the estuary having the potential to increase oxygen consumption and reduce the photic depth.},

  abstract = {The release of ammonium from the photochemical degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been proposed by earlier studies as a potentially important remineralisation pathway for refractory organic nitrogen. In this study the photochemical production of ammonium from Baltic Sea DOM was assessed in the laboratory. Filtered samples from the Bothnian Bay, the Gulf of Finland and the Arkona Sea were exposed to UVA light at environmentally relevant levels, and the developments in ammonium concentrations, light absorption, fluorescence and molecular size distribution were followed. The exposures resulted in a decrease in DOM absorption and loss of the larger sized fraction of DOM. Analysis of the fluorescence properties of DOM using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) identified 6 independent components. Five components decreased in intensity as a result of the UVA exposures. One component was produced as a result of the exposures and represents labile photoproducts derived from terrestrial DOM. The characteristics of DOM in samples from the Bothnian Bay and Gulf of Finland were similar and dominated by terrestrially derived material. The DOM from the Arkona Sea was more autochthonous in character. Photoammonification differed depending on the composition of DOM. Calculated photoammonification rates in surface waters varied between 121 and 382 mu mol NH4+ L-1 d(-1). Estimated areal daily production rates ranged between 37 and 237 mu mol NH4+ m(-2) d(-1), which are comparable to atmospheric deposition rates and suggest that photochemical remineralisation of organic nitrogen may be a significant source of bioavailable nitrogen to surface waters during summer months with high irradiance and low inorganic nitrogen concentrations.

PARAFAC analysis identified five fluorescent components, all of which were present in both sea ice and water. Three humic components were negatively correlated to salinity and concluded to be terrestrially derived material. Baltic Sea ice DOM was found to be a mixture of humic material from the underlying water column incorporated during ice formation and autochthonous material produced by organism within the ice. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations were correlated to the humic fluorescence, indicating that the majority of the organic carbon and nitrogen in Baltic Sea ice is bound in terrestrial humic material trapped within the ice. This has implications for our understanding of sea ice carbon cycling in regions influenced by riverine input (e.g., Baltic and Arctic coastal waters), as the susceptibility of DOM to degradation and remineralization is largely determined by its source.},

The aim was to assess the validity of predicting CDOM absorption in the region on the basis of water mass mixing alone and demonstrate the utility of CDOM as an indicator of water mass mixing in coastal seas. A three-end-member mixing model representing the three major allochthonous CDOM sources was sufficient to describe the patterns in CDOM absorption distribution observed. The three-end-member water masses were the: Baltic outflow, German Bight and the central North Sea. Previously, it was thought that water from the German Bight transported northwards in the Jutland coastal current only sporadically influenced mixing between the Baltic and North Sea. The results from this study show that water from the German Bight is detectable at salinities down to 12 in the Kattegat and Belt Sea. On average, 23\% of the CDOM in bottom waters of the Kattegat, Great Belt, Belt Sea, Arkona Sea and the Sound originated from the German Bight. Using this conservative mixing model approach, local CDOM inputs were detectable but found to be limited, representing only 0.25\% of CDOM in the surface waters of the Kattegat and Belt Sea. The conservative mixing of CDOM makes it possible to predict its distribution and characteristics and offers a powerful tool for tracing water mass mixing in the region. The results also emphasize the need to include the Jutland Coastal current in hydrodynamic models for the region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Two years of river data from six major Arctic rivers (Kolyma, Lena, Ob, Mackenzie, Yenisei, and Yukon) and measurements from a transect across the Arctic Ocean are presented. The results show that although the Lena River currently dominates the supply of DOC and CDOM, climate change induced increases in base flow discharge will likely increase the contribution of the Yenisei River. Seasonal variations in the spectral characteristics of CDOM in the rivers reflected the shift in the dominant source of organic matter from modern plant litter in the spring freshet to older more degraded material during winter low flow periods. Strong correlations were found between the river loading of CDOM and DOC across the systems studied indicating that in situ CDOM sensors could be used in the future to improve estimates of riverine DOC loading. CDOM in the surface waters of the Eurasian Basin was largely characterised as riverine material although extrapolations to riverine end member concentrations suggested that approximately half the riverine CDOM is removed during its transport across the shelf. In contrast the Canadian Basin surface waters were characterised by a much greater proportion of autochthonous CDOM. These differences in DOM quality in the surface waters of the two basins are hypothesised to also influence the extent to which material is remineralised during its passage through the Arctic Ocean. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The results from global surveys and experimental incubations indicate that CDOM measurements have the potential to be optical markers which trace the turnover of a DOM fraction that is not otherwise apparent from elemental analyses. A remaining key challenge is to evaluate how much of the carbon bound in DOM is associated with CDOM.},

Abundance and bacterial production (BP) of heterotrophic bacteria (HBact) were measured in the north and south basins of Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, during seasonal sampling series between 2002 and 2007. The major objective of the study was to assess whether BP can supplement phytoplankton particulate primary production (particulate PP) in the pelagic waters, and whether BP and particulate PP are related in this large lake. HBact were enumerated in the 0-100 m surface layer by epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry; BP was quantified using H-3-thymidine incorporation, usually in three mixolimnion layers (0-40, 40-60 and 60-100 m). 2. Flow cytometry allowed three subpopulations to be distinguished: low nucleic acid content bacteria (LNA), high nucleic acid content bacteria (HNA) and Synechococcus-like picocyanobacteria (PCya). The proportion of HNA was on average 67\% of total bacterial abundance, and tended to increase with depth. HBact abundance was between 1.2 x 10(5) and 4.8 x 10(6) cells mL(-1), and was maximal in the 0-40 m layer (i.e. roughly, the euphotic layer). Using a single conversion factor of 15 fg C cell(-1), estimated from biovolume measurements, average HBact biomass (integrated over a 100-m water column depth) was 1.89 +/- 1.05 g C m(-2). 3. Significant differences in BP appeared between seasons, especially in the south basin. The range of BP integrated over the 0-100 m layer was 93-735 mg C m(-2) day(-1), and overlapped with the range of particulate PP (150-1687 mg C m(-2) day(-1)) measured in the same period of time at the same sites. 4. Depth-integrated BP was significantly correlated to particulate PP and chlorophyll-a, and BP in the euphotic layer was on average 25\% of PP. 5. These results suggest that HBact contribute substantially to the particulate organic carbon available to consumers in Lake Tanganyika, and that BP may be sustained by phytoplankton-derived organic carbon in the pelagic waters.},

  abstract = {Most nitrogen and phosphorus transported by world rivers to the oceans is associated with dissolved organic matter. However, organic matter as a potential source of N and P has hitherto been largely neglected in studies of coastal microbial food webs. We examined 50 rivers, draining a major part of the Baltic Sea watershed, with respect to summer concentrations, chemical composition, and biological availability of N and P. The broad spectrum of rivers studied enabled us to assess whether the input of terrigenous organic matter can be an important nutrient source, at various levels of anthropogenic loading of inorganic N and P. Concentrations of total N and P ranged from 9 to 220 mumol/L and from 0.14 to 5.56 mumol/L, respectively, with the highest concentrations in the southern part of the Baltic Sea drainage area and in several rivers on the Finnish western coast. Urea and dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA) each constituted 4-20\% of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), while dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) made up {$<$}3\% of DON. The contribution of urea and amino acids to the DON pool was inversely correlated with DON concentration. Bacterial regrowth bioassays in selected rivers demonstrated that similar to30\% of DON and similar to75\% of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) was potentially available to the indigenous bacterial assemblage of the Baltic Sea, and hence susceptible to mineralization within the pelagic food web. Our study is among the first to demonstrate that bacterioplankton are able to utilize a major part of DON and DOP from a broad spectrum of natural waters. The C:N ratio, absorbance spectra, and fluorescence properties of the organic matter suggest that the observed high bioavailability of DON and DOP was due to a large contribution of organic matter from riverine primary production compared to the humic matter derived from terrestrial vascular plants. In addition, algal and bacterial cells dominated the transport of particulate organic material, further enhancing productivity of coastal waters. No correlations were found between DON bioavailability and the fraction of DON bound in urea and amino acids, indicating a utilization of other N compounds (e.g., amides) by the bacteria. We estimate that the input of summer riverine N to the Baltic Sea consists of 48\% dissolved inorganic N, 41 \% DON, and 11 \% particulate N. Corresponding values for phosphorus are 46\%, 18\%, and 36\% of dissolved inorganic P, DOP, and particulate P, respectively. During the thermal summer stratification, when freshwater inputs are trapped in the surface layer, rivers contribute similar to30\% of N and similar to5\% of P needed to support the export production (plankton sedimenting out of the photic layer) in the Baltic Sea. The high availability to bacteria suggests that DOP is a major stimulator of pelagic productivity in the P-limited northern part of the Baltic Sea. Based on reported concentrations in other areas, we suggest that the global contribution of riverine organic N and P to the primary production of coastal waters is comparable to the contribution of inorganic nutrients.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We have examined several approaches for estimating the surface concentration of particulate organic carbon, POC, from optical measurements of spectral remote-sensing reflectance, Rrs({$\lambda$}), using field data collected in tropical and subtropical waters of the eastern South Pacific and eastern Atlantic Oceans. These approaches include a direct empirical relationship between POC and the blue-to-green band ratio of reflectance, Rrs({$\lambda$}B)/Rrs(555), and two-step algorithms that consist of relationships linking reflectance to an inherent optical property IOP (beam attenuation or backscattering coefficient) and POC to the IOP. We considered two-step empirical algorithms that exclusively include pairs of empirical relationships and two-step hybrid algorithms that consist of semianalytical models and empirical relationships. The surface POC in our data set ranges from about 10 mg m-3 within the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre to 270 mg m-3 in the Chilean upwelling area, and ancillary data suggest a considerable variation in the characteristics of particulate assemblages in the investigated waters. The POC algorithm based on the direct relationship between POC and Rrs({$\lambda$}B)/Rrs(555) promises reasonably good performance in the vast areas of the open ocean covering different provinces from hyperoligotrophic and oligotrophic waters within subtropical gyres to eutrophic coastal upwelling regimes characteristic of eastern ocean boundaries. The best error statistics were found for power function fits to the data of POC vs. Rrs(443)/Rrs(555) and POC vs. Rrs(490)/Rrs(555). For our data set that includes over 50 data pairs, these relationships are characterized by the mean normalized bias of about 2\% and the normalized root mean square error of about 20\%. We recommend that these algorithms be implemented for routine processing of ocean color satellite data to produce maps of surface POC with the status of an evaluation data product for continued work on algorithm development and refinements. The two-step algorithms also deserve further attention because they can utilize various models for estimating IOPs from reflectance, offer advantages for developing an understanding of bio-optical variability underlying the algorithms, and provide flexibility for regional or seasonal parameterizations of the algorithms.},

Spectrophotometric measurement of particulate matter retained on filters is the most common and practical method for routine determination of the spectral light abs orption coefficient of aquatic particles, a p ({$\lambda$}), at high spectral resolution over a broad spectral range. The use of differing geometrical measurement configurations and large variations in the reported correction for pathlength amplification induced by the particle/filter matrix have hindered adoption of an established measurement protocol. We describe results of dedicated laboratory experiments with a diversity of particulate sample types to examine variation in the pathlength amplification factor for three filter measurement geometries; the filter in the transmittance configuration (T), the filter in the transmittance- reflectance configuration (T-R), and the filter placed inside an integrating sphere (IS). Relationships between optical density measured on suspensions (OD s ) and filters (OD f ) within the visible portion of the spectrum were evaluated for the formulation of pathlength amplification correction, with power functions providing the best functional representation of the relationship for all three geometries. Whereas the largest uncertainties occur in the T method, the IS method provided the least sample-to-sample variability and the smallest uncertainties in the relationship between OD s and OD f . For six different samples measured with 1 nm resolution within the light wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm, a median error of 7.1\% is observed for predicted values of OD s using the IS method. The relationships established for the three filter-pad methods are applicable to historical and ongoing measurements; for future work, the use of the IS method is recommended whenever feasible.}

Understanding these transitions is a key goal of sustainability science because they can represent abrupt losses of natural capital. This paper recognizes flickering between alternate land surface states in advance of threshold change and critical slowing down in advance of both threshold changes and noncritical transformation. The early warning signals we observe are rises in autocorrelation, variance, and skewness within millimeter-resolution thickness measurements of tephra layers deposited in A.D. 2010 and A.D. 2011. These signals reflect changing patterns of surface vegetation, which are known to provide early warning signals of critical transformations. They were observed toward migrating soil erosion fronts, cryoturbation limits, and expanding deflation zones, thus providing potential early warning signals of land surface change. The record of the spatial patterning of vegetation contained in contemporary tephra layers shows how proximity to land surface change could be assessed in the widespread regions affected by shallow layers of volcanic fallout (those that can be subsumed within the existing vegetation cover). This insight shows how we could use tephra layers in the stratigraphic record to identify "near misses," close encounters with thresholds that did not lead to tipping points, and thus provide additional tools for archaeology, sustainability science, and contemporary land management.},

  abstract = {Species richness has dominated our view of global biodiversity patterns for centuries. The dominance of this paradigm is reflected in the focus by ecologists and conservation managers on richness and associated occurrence-based measures for understanding drivers of broad-scale diversity patterns and as a biological basis for management. However, this is changing rapidly, as it is now recognized that not only the number of species but the species present, their phenotypes and the number of individuals of each species are critical in determining the nature and strength of the relationships between species diversity and a range of ecological functions (such as biomass production and nutrient cycling). Integrating these measures should provide a more relevant representation of global biodiversity patterns in terms of ecological functions than that provided by simple species counts. Here we provide comparisons of a traditional global biodiversity distribution measure based on richness with metrics that incorporate species abundances and functional traits. We use data from standardized quantitative surveys of 2,473 marine reef fish species at 1,844 sites, spanning 133 degrees of latitude from all ocean basins, to identify new diversity hotspots in some temperate regions and the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. These relate to high diversity of functional traits amongst individuals in the community (calculated using Rao's Q), and differ from previously reported patterns in functional diversity and richness for terrestrial animals, which emphasize species-rich tropical regions only. There is a global trend for greater evenness in the number of individuals of each species, across the reef fish species observed at sites ('community evenness'), at higher latitudes. This contributes to the distribution of functional diversity hotspots and contrasts with well-known latitudinal gradients in richness. Our findings suggest that the contribution of species diversity to a range of ecosystem functions varies over large scales, and imply that in tropical regions, which have higher numbers of species, each species contributes proportionally less to community-level ecological processes on average than species in temperate regions. Metrics of ecological function usefully complement metrics of species diversity in conservation management, including when identifying planning priorities and when tracking changes to biodiversity values.},

  abstract = {Dissolved black carbon (DBC), defined here as condensed aromatics isolated from seawater via PPL solid phase extraction and quantified as benzenepolycarboxylic acid (BPCA) oxidation products, is a significant component of the oceanic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. These condensed aromatics are widely distributed in the open ocean and appear to be tens of thousands of years old. As such DBC is regarded as highly refractory. In the current study, the photo-lability of DBC, DOC and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM; ultraviolet-visible absorbance) were determined over the course of a 28 day irradiation of North Atlantic Deep Water under a solar simulator. During the irradiation DBC fell from 1044 {$\pm$} 164 nM-C to 55 {$\pm$} 15 nM-C, a 20-fold decrease in concentration. Dissolved black carbon photo-degradation was more rapid and more extensive than for bulk CDOM and DOC. The concentration of DBC correlated with CDOM absorbance and the quality of DBC indicated by the ratios of different BPCAs correlated with CDOM absorbance spectral slope, suggesting the optical properties of CDOM may provide a proxy for both DBC concentrations and quality in natural waters. Further, the photo-lability of components of the DBC pool increased with their degree of aromatic condensation. These trends indicate that a continuum of compounds of varying photo-lability exists within the marine DOC pool. In this continuum, photo-lability scales with aromatic character, specifically the degree of condensation. Scaling the rapid photo-degradation of DBC to rates of DOC photo-mineralisation for the global ocean leads to an estimated photo-chemical half-life for oceanic DBC of less than 800 years. This is more than an order of magnitude shorter than the apparent age of DBC in the ocean. Consequently, photo-degradation is posited as the primary sink for oceanic DBC and the apparent survival of DBC molecules in the oceans for millennia appears to be facilitated not by their inherent inertness but by the rate at which they are cycled through the surface ocean's photic zone.},

Modern fluorescence techniques couple measurements of excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to determine fluorescent DOM (FDOM) components and DOM quality. However, the molecular signatures associated with PARAFAC components are poorly defined. In the current study we characterized river water samples from boreal Qu\'ebec, Canada, using EEM/PARAFAC analysis and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Spearman's correlation of FTICR-MS peak and PARAFAC component relative intensities determined the molecular families associated with 6 PARAFAC components. Molecular families associated with PARAFAC components numbered from 39 to 572 FTICR-MS derived elemental formulas. Detailed molecular properties for each of the classical humic- and protein-like FDOM components are presented. FTICR-MS formulas assigned to PARAFAC components represented 39\% of the total number of formulas identified and 59\% of total FTICR-MS peak intensities, and included significant numbers compounds that are highly unlikely to fluoresce. Thus, fluorescence measurements offer insight into the biogeochemical cycling of a large proportion of the DOM pool, including a broad suite of unseen molecules that apparently follow the same gradients as FDOM in the environment.},

  abstract = {Wildfires have produced black carbon (BC) since land plants emerged. Condensed aromatic compounds, a form of BC, have accumulated to become a major component of the soil carbon pool. Condensed aromatics leach from soils into rivers, where they are termed dissolved black carbon (DBC). The transport of DBC by rivers to the sea is a major term in the global carbon and BC cycles. To estimate Arctic river DBC export, 25 samples collected from the six largest Arctic rivers (Kolyma, Lena, Mackenzie, Ob', Yenisey, and Yukon) were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and DBC. A simple, linear regression between DOC and DBC indicated that DBC accounted for 8.9 {$\pm$} 0.3\% of DOC exported by Arctic rivers. To improve upon this estimate, an optical proxy for DBC was developed based upon the linear correlation between DBC concentrations and CDOM light absorption coefficients at 254nm (a254). Relatively easy to measure a254 values were determined for 410 Arctic river samples between 2004 and 2010. Each of these a254 values was converted to a DBC concentration based upon the linear correlation, providing an extended record of DBC concentration. The extended DBC record was coupled with daily discharge data fromthe six rivers to estimate riverine DBCloads using the LOADEST modeling program. The six rivers studied cover 53\% of the pan-Arctic watershed and exported 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.1 million tons of DBC per year. Scaling up to the full area of the pan-Arctic watershed, we estimate that Arctic rivers carry 2.8 {$\pm$} 0.3 million tons of DBC from land to the Arctic Ocean each year. This equates to {$\sim$}8\% of Arctic river DOC export, slightly less than indicated by the simpler DBC vs. DOC correlation-based estimate. Riverine discharge is predicted to increase in a warmer Arctic. DBC export was positively correlated with river runoff, suggesting that the export of soil BC to the Arctic Ocean is likely to increase as the Arctic warms.},

The data were collected in four field areas: three on the coastal sea ice near Barrow, AK, and the fourth out on the open ice pack 175 km northeast of Barrow. The snow depth ranged from 9.4-20.8 cm in coastal areas (n=9881 for three areas) with the thinnest snow on ice that had formed late in the winter. Out in the main pack ice, the snow was 20.6 cm deep (n=1906). The ice in all four areas ranged from 138-219 cm thick (n=1952), with the lower value again where the ice had formed late in the winter. Snow layer and grain characteristics observed in 118 snow pits indicated that 44\% of observed snow layers were depth hoar; 46\% were wind slab. Snow and ice measurements were keyed to photomosaics produced from low-altitude vertical aerial photographs. Using these, and a distinctive three-way relationship between ice roughness, snow surface characteristics, and snow depth, strip maps of snow depth, each about 2 km wide, were produced bracketing the traverse lines. These maps contain an unprecedented level of snow depth detail against which to compare remote sensing products. The maps are used in other papers in this special issue to examine the retrieval of snow properties from the PSR and AMSR-E sensors},

  abstract = {Establishing vegetated buffer strips (VBS) between cropland and watercourses is currently promoted as a principal control of diffuse pollution transport. However, we lackthe mechanistic understanding to evaluate P retention in VBS and predict risks of P transport to aquatic ecosystems. We observed that VBS establishment led to enhanced rates of soil P cycling, increasing soil P solubility and the potential amount leached to watercourses. Soil in VBS, relative to adjacentfields, had increased inorganic P solubility indices, dissolved organic P, phosphatase enzyme activity, microbial diversity, and biomass P. Small relative increases in the pool of soil P rendered labile had disproportionate effects on the P available for leaching. We propose a mechanism whereby the establishment of VBS on previous agricultural land causes a diversifying plant-microbial system which can access previous immobilized soil P from past fertilization or trapped sediment P. Laboratory experiments suggested that sediment-P inputs to VBS were insufficient alone to increase P solubility without biological cycling. Results showthat VBS management may require strategies, for example, harvesting vegetation, to offset biochemical processes that can increase the susceptibility of VBS soil P to move to adjoining streams.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

After incubation of epilimnetic lake water samples with HCO(3) over one diel cycle, the phytoplankton were removed by size-selective filtration. The filtrates, still containing most of the heterotrophic bacteria, were reincubated in darkness (heterotrophic incubation). Differences in the amount and composition of PDOC between samples collected before the heterotrophic incubation and samples collected afterwards were considered to be a result of bacterial utilization. The PDOC collected at the start of the heterotrophic incubations always contained both high ({$>$}10,000)- and low ({$<$}1,000)-molecular-weight (MW) components and sometimes contained intermediate-MW components as well. In general, bacterial turnover rates of the low-MW components were fairly rapid, whereas the high-MW components were utilized slowly or not at all. In the humic lake, the intermediate-MW components accounted for a large proportion of the net PDOC and were subject to rapid bacterial utilization. This fraction probably consisted almost entirely of polysaccharides of ca. 6,000 MW. Amino acids and peptides, other organic acids, and carbohydrates could all be quantitatively important parts of the low-MW PDOC that was utilized by the heterotrophic bacteria, but the relative contributions of these fractions differed widely. It was concluded that, generally, low-MW components of PDOC are quantitatively much more important to the bacteria than are high-MW components, that PDOC released from phytoplankton does not contain substances of quantitative importance as bacterial substrates in all situations, and that high-MW components of PDOC probably contribute to the buildup of refractory, high-MW dissolved organic carbon in pelagic environments.},

  abstract = {The cycling pathways of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) within marine systems must be constrained to better assess the impact of CDOM on surface ocean photochemistry and remote sensing of ocean color. Photobleaching, the loss of absorption by CDOM due to light exposure, is the primary sink for marine CDOM. Herein the susceptibility of CDOM to photobleaching by sea surface- level solar radiation was examined in 15 samples collected from wide-ranging open ocean regimes. Samples from the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Southern Oceans were irradiated over several days with full-spectrum light under a solar simulator at in situ temperature in order to measure photobleaching rate and derive an empiricalmatrix, esurf (m1 mEin1), which quantifies the effect of surface irradiance on the spectral absorption of CDOM. Irradiation responses among the ocean samples were similar within the ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum spanning 300\textendash 360 nm, generally exhibiting a decrease in the CDOM absorption coefficient (m1) and concomitant increase in the CDOM spectral slope parameter, S (nm1). However, an unexpected irradiation-induced increase in CDOM absorption between approximately 360 and 500 nm was observed for samples from high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) environments. This finding was linked to the presence of dissolved nitrate and may explain discrepancies in action spectra for dimethylsulfide (DMS) photobleaching observed between the Equatorial Pacific and Subtropical North Atlantic Oceans. The nitrate-to-phosphate ratio explained 27\textendash 70\% of observed variability in esurf at observation wavelengths of 330\textendash 440 nm, while the initial spectral slope of the samples explained up to 52\% of variability in esurf at observation wavelengths of 310\textendash 330 nm. These results suggest that the biogeochemical and solar exposure history of the water column, each of which influence the chemical character and thus the spectral quality of CDOM and its photoreactivity, are the main factors regulating the susceptibility of CDOM to photodegradation in the surface ocean. The esurf parameter reported herein may be applied to remote sensing retrievals of CDOM to estimate photobleaching at the surface on regional to global scales.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) fuels the majority of in-stream microbial processes, including the removal of nitrate via denitrification. However, little is known about how the chemical composition of DOM influences denitrification rates. Water and sediment samples were collected across an ecosystem gradient, spanning the alpine to plains, in central Colorado to determine whether the chemical composition of DOM was related to denitrification rates. Laboratory bioassays measured denitrification potentials using the acetylene block technique and carbon mineralization via aerobic bioassays, while organic matter characteristics were evaluated using spectroscopic and fractionation methods. Denitrification potentials under ambient and elevated nitrate concentrations were strongly correlated with aerobic respiration rates and the percent mineralized carbon, suggesting that information about the aerobic metabolism of a system can provide valuable insight regarding the ability of the system to additionally reduce nitrate. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) revealed that under elevated nitrate concentrations denitrification potentials were positively related to the presence of protein-like fluorophores and negatively related to more aromatic and oxidized fractions of the DOM pool. Using MLR, the chemical composition of DOM, carbon, and nitrate concentrations explained 70\% and 78\% of the observed variability in denitrification potential under elevated and ambient nitrate conditions, respectively. Thus, it seems likely that DOM optical properties could help to improve predictions of nitrate removal in the environment. Finally, fluorescence measurements revealed that bacteria used both protein and humic-like organic molecules during denitrification providing further evidence that larger, more aromatic molecules are not necessarily recalcitrant in the environment.},

Across high latitudes, thawing permafrost, alteration of hydrologic flow paths, and changes in vegetation may all affect this flux, with subsequent implications for regional and global carbon (C) budgets. Using a unique, multi-decadal dataset of continuous discharge coupled with water chemistry measurements for the Mackenzie River, we show major increases in dissolved OC (DOC) and IC (as alkalinity) fluxes since the early 1970s, for a watershed that covers 1.8 M km2 of northwestern Canada, and provides substantial inputs of freshwater and biogeochemical constituents to the Arctic Ocean. Over a 39-year period of record, DOC flux at the Mackenzie mouth increased by 39.3\% (44.5 {$\pm$} 22.6 Gmol), while alkalinity flux increased by 12.5\% (61.5 {$\pm$} 60.1 Gmol). Isotopic analyses and substantial increases in sulfate flux indicate that increases in alkalinity are driven by accelerating sulfide oxidation, a process that liberates IC from rock and soils in the absence of CO2 consumption. Seasonal and sub-catchment trends suggest that permafrost thaw plays an important role in the observed increases in DOC and alkalinity: sub-catchment increases for all constituents are confined to northern, permafrost-affected regions, while observed increases in autumn to winter are consistent with documented landscape-scale changes that have resulted from changing thaw dynamics. This increase in DOC and sulfide-derived alkalinity represents a substantial intensification of land-to-ocean C mobilization, at a level that is significant within the regional C budget. The change we observe, for example, is similar to current and projected future rates of CO2 consumption by weathering in the Mackenzie basin.},

  abstract = {Ice-rich permafrost coasts in the Arctic are highly sensitive to climate warming and erode at a pace that exceeds the global average. Permafrost coasts deliver vast amounts of organic carbon into the nearshore zone of the Arctic Ocean. Numbers on flux exist for particulate organic carbon (POC) and total or soil organic carbon (TOC, SOC). However, they do not exist for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is known to be highly bioavailable. This study aims to estimate DOC stocks in coastal permafrost as well as the annual flux into the ocean. DOC concentrations in ground ice were analyzed along the ice-rich Yukon coast (YC) in the western Canadian Arctic. The annual DOC flux was estimated using available numbers for coast length, cliff height, annual erosion rate, and volumetric ice content in different stratigraphic horizons. Our results showed that DOC concentrations in ground ice range between 0.3 and 347.0 mg L-1 with an estimated stock of 13.6 {$\pm$} 3.0 g m-3 along the YC. An annual DOC flux of 54.9 {$\pm$} 0.9 Mg yr-1 was computed. These DOC fluxes are low compared to POC and SOC fluxes from coastal erosion or POC and DOC fluxes from Arctic rivers. We conclude that DOC fluxes from permafrost coasts play a secondary role in the Arctic carbon budget. However, this DOC is assumed to be highly bioavailable. We hypothesize that DOC from coastal erosion is important for ecosystems in the Arctic nearshore zones, particularly in summer when river discharge is low, and in areas where rivers are absent.},

Consequently, terrestrial organic matter (OM) is mobilized and transported into the nearshore zone. Yet, little is known about the fate of mobilized OM before and after entering the ocean. In this study we investigated a retrogressive thaw slump (RTS) on Qikiqtaruk - Herschel Island (Yukon coast, Canada). The RTS was classified into an undisturbed, a disturbed (thermokarst-affected) and a nearshore zone and sampled systematically along transects. Samples were analyzed for total and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (TOC, DOC, TN, DN), stable carbon isotopes ({$\delta$}13C-TOC, {$\delta$}13C-DOC), and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), which were compared between the zones. C/N-ratios, {$\delta$}13C signatures, and ammonium (NH4-N) concentrations were used as indicators for OM degradation along with biomarkers (n-alkanes, n-fatty acids, n-alcohols). Our results show that OM significantly decreases after disturbance with a TOC and DOC loss of 77 and 55\% and a TN and DN loss of 53 and 48\%, respectively. C/N-ratios decrease significantly, whereas NH4-N concentrations slightly increase in freshly thawed material. In the nearshore zone, OM contents are comparable to the disturbed zone. We suggest that the strong decrease in OM is caused by initial dilution with melted massive ice and immediate offshore transport via the thaw stream. In the mudpool and thaw stream, OM is subject to degradation, whereas in the slump floor the nitrogen decrease is caused by recolonizing vegetation. Within the nearshore zone of the ocean, heavier portions of OM are directly buried in marine sediments close to shore. We conclude that RTS have profound impacts on coastal environments in the Arctic. They mobilize nutrients from permafrost, substantially decrease OM contents and provide fresh water and nutrients at a point source.},

We mimicked erosion in an experiment by incubating permafrost with seawater for an average Arctic open-water season.

  abstract = {A thorough sensitivity analysis of the 'Transmittance - Reflectance' (T-R) method for measuring in vivo light absorption by aquatic particles retained on glass-fiber filters has been carried out. Particular attention has been devoted to the error contribution by the variability of the optical properties of the GF/F filters used. The overall error of the measurement of the filter-retained particle optical density, ODs, has been evaluated as {$\sim$}0.002 (1 {$\sigma$}), with 0.0015 error contribution by the filter variability. The corresponding error of the optical density of the particle suspension, ODsus, has been obtained by differentiation of the equation expressing the experimental correlation (ODsus versus ODs); the error increases with the optical density value, from {$\sigma$} = 0.0015 (for ODsus = 0.05) to {$\sigma$} = 0.027 at the upper limit of the optical density range tested (ODsus = 0.59). The validity range of the experimental (ODsus versus ODs) correlation has been shown to extend to ODs = 0.75. The importance of the accurate correction for light backscattering performed by the T-R method has been investigated by comparison with results given by the standard 'Transmittance' (T) method; it has been shown that the coarse correction for light scattering included in the T method may cause serious errors in the measured optical density spectra of mineral detritus. This evidence confirms the need to resort to the T-R method for the measurement of particle samples of detritus-rich coastal waters. The paper summarizes the latest developments of the T-R method and includes an Appendix with a synopsis of the routine now used by the authors.}

  abstract = {We measured the abundance and biomass of phototrophic and heterotrophic microbes in the upper mixed layer of the water column in ice-covered Franklin Bay, Beaufort Sea, Canada, from December 2003 to May 2004, and evaluated the influence of light and nutrients on these communities by way of a shipboard enrichment experiment. Bacterial cell concentrations showed no consistent trends throughout the sampling period, averaging ({$\pm$} SD) 2.4 (0.9) \texttimes{} 108 cells L- 1; integrated bacterial biomass for the upper mixed layer ranged from 1.33 mg C m- 3 to 3.60 mg C m- 3. Small cells numerically dominated the heterotrophic protist community in both winter and spring, but in terms of biomass, protists with a diameter {$>$} 10 {$\mu$}m generally dominated the standing stocks. Heterotrophic protist biomass integrated over the upper mixed layer ranged from 1.23 mg C m- 3 to 6.56 mg C m- 3. Phytoplankton biomass was low and variable, but persisted during the winter period. The standing stock of pigment-containing protists ranged from a minimum value of 0.38 mg C m- 3 in winter to a maximal value of 6.09 mg C m- 3 in spring and the most abundant taxa were Micromonas-like cells. These picoprasinophytes began to increase under the ice in February and their population size was positively correlated with surface irradiance. Despite the continuing presence of sea ice, phytoplankton biomass rose by more than an order of magnitude in the upper mixed layer by May. The shipboard experiment in April showed that this phototrophic increase in the community was not responsive to pulsed nutrient enrichment, with all treatments showing a strong growth response to improved irradiance conditions. Molecular (DGGE) and microscopic analyses indicated that most components of the eukaryotic community responded positively to the light treatment. These results show the persistence of a phototrophic inoculum throughout winter darkness, and the strong seasonal response by arctic microbial food webs to sub-ice irradiance in early spring. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Multivariate methods were used to partition the variability in a spatio-temporal species dataset (12 sampling depths, 19 dates, 6 species) into pure spatial, temporal, environmental and shared components. Using this approach, 51 \% of the variation of the zooplankton community could be explained. Broad-scale spatial organization in the zooplankton community (i.e. water column scale variation that Could be explained as a simple first-order function of depth) accounted for 23 \% of the explained variation. Approximately half of this variation was shared with depth-wise variations in water temperature variables. Due to the discontinuity of the thermally stratified water Column, there existed a component of the shared variation between water temperature variables and zooplankton community structure that could not be explained by a simple first-order function of depth. By statistically modelling the discontinuous nature of the thermally stratified water column For a series of discrete time periods, thermocline position was found to explain between 9 and 22\% of the total variation in community structure. This indicated that spatial variations in the community composition included a discontinuous component, that coincided with the thermocline.},

In this study we tested the effect of different freezing methods (standard freezing at -18 \textdegree C and fast-freezing with liquid nitrogen) on DOM concentrations measured as organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and on spectroscopic properties of DOM from different terrestrial ecosystems (forest and grassland). Fresh and differently frozen throughfall, stemflow, litter leachate and soil solution samples were analyzed for DOC concentrations, UV-vis absorption and fluorescence excitation\textendash emission matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Fast-freezing with liquid nitrogen prevented a significant decrease of DOC concentrations observed after freezing at -18 \textdegree C.

The contribution of PARAFAC component 4 (EXmax: 280 nm, EXmax: 328 nm) to total fluorescence was not affected by freezing. We recommend fast-freezing with liquid nitrogen for preservation of bulk DOC concentrations of samples from terrestrial sources, whereas immediate measuring is preferable to preserve spectroscopic properties of DOM.},

This riverine ecosystem synthesis (RES) provides a framework for understanding both broad, often discontinuous patterns along longitudinal and lateral dimensions of river networks and local ecological patterns across various temporal and smaller spatial scales. Rather than posing a completely new model, we arrange a conceptual marriage of eco-geomorphology (ecological aspects of fluvial geomorphology) with a terrestrial landscape model describing hierarchical patch dynamics. We modify five components of this terrestrial model for lotic ecosystems: (1) nested, discontinuous hierarchies of patch mosaics; (2) ecosystem dynamics as a composite of intra- and inter-patch dynamics; (3) linked patterns and processes; (4) dominance of non-equilibria] and stochastic processes; and (5) formation of a quasi-equilibrial, metastable state. Our conceptual model blends our perspectives on biocomplexity with aspects of aquatic models proposed from 1980-2004. Contrasting with a common view of rivers as continuous, longitudinal gradients in physical conditions, the RES portrays rivers as downstream arrays of large hydrogeomorphic patches (e.g. constricted, braided and floodplain channel areas) formed by catchment geomorphology and climate. The longitudinal distribution of these patches, which are identifiable using standard geomorphic techniques, varies amongst rivers and is difficult to forecast above ecoregional scales. Some types of hydrogeomorphic patches may reoccur along this downstream passage. Unique ecological 'functional process zones' are formed by individual types of hydrogeomorphic patches because of physiochemical habitat differences which affect ecosystem structure and function. The RES currently includes 14 tenets predicting how patterns of individual species distributions, community regulation, lotic ecosystem processes, and floodplain interactions will vary over spatiotemporal scales, especially as they relate to the functional process zones formed by hydrogeomorphic differences in the river network.

  abstract = {The use of fluorescence spectroscopy for recording multiple excitation and corresponding emission wavelengths and the subsequent technique of analyzing the resulting fluorescence landscapes is a rather new method as opposed to the use of just a single excitation wavelength. In a fluorescence landscape, several light-scatter effects are usually present, and often the part of the landscape containing information on the chemical and/or physical characteristics of the sample is surrounded by two Rayleigh scatter lines. When such landscapes are decomposed using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), the scatter effects may have detrimental effects on the resolved spectra, especially if the peaks from the analytes lie close to or on the Rayleigh scatter lines. Normally, all values close to and outside the Rayleigh scatter lines are set to missing values before decomposing the fluorescence landscapes by PARAFAC. In this paper, we introduce a novel pretreatment method applicable for two-dimensional fluorescence landscapes, where instead of inserting only missing values a mixture of zeros and missing values are inserted close to and outside the Rayleigh scatter lines. It is shown that, by the use of this technique, a physically and chemically meaningful decomposition is obtained, and furthermore the modeling converges faster. Constraining the PARAFAC solution to positive values in all modes gave results similar to those obtained for the unconstrained model, except that the loadings where less smooth and the number of iterations before convergence was smaller.

To determine the degree of specificity in the use of an exudate by bacterial taxa, we used simple microalgae-bacteria model systems. We isolated 92 bacterial strains from the sea ice bottom and the water column in spring-summer in the Baffin Bay (Arctic Ocean). The isolates were grouped into 42 species belonging to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Forty strains were tested for their capacity to grow on the exudate from two Arctic diatoms. Most of the strains tested (78\%) were able to grow on the exudate from the pelagic diatom Chaetoceros neogracilis, and 33\% were able to use the exudate from the sea ice diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus. 17.5\% of the strains were not able to grow with any exudate, while 27.5\% of the strains were able to use both types of exudates. All strains belonging to Flavobacteriia (n = 10) were able to use the DOM provided by C. neogracilis, and this exudate sustained a growth capacity of up to 100 times higher than diluted Marine Broth medium, of two Pseudomonas sp. strains and one Sulfitobacter strain. The variable bioavailability of exudates to bacterial strains highlights the potential role of microalgae in shaping the bacterial community composition.

We find that species richness and endemism patterns are significantly correlated among taxa. We also show that cross-taxon congruence patterns are often induced by common responses of taxa to their contemporary and historical environments (i.e. convergent patterns). Apart from some taxa distinctiveness (i.e. fishes), the 'climate/productivity' hypothesis is found to explain the greatest variance in species richness and endemism patterns, followed by factors related to the 'history/dispersion' and 'area/environmental heterogeneity' hypotheses. As aquatic amphibians display the highest levels of congruency with other taxa, this taxon appears to be a good 'surrogate' candidate for developing global freshwater conservation planning at the river drainage basin grain.},

Molecular lipid biomarkers (hydrocarbons, alcohols, sterols and fatty acids) and compound-specific isotope analysis of suspended particulate organic matter (SPM) and surface sediments of the Mackenzie Shelf and slope (southeast Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean) were studied in summer 2009. The concentrations of the molecular lipid markers, characteristic of known organic matter sources, were grouped and used as proxies to evaluate the relative importance of fresh algal, detrital algal, fossil, C3 terrestrial plants, bacterial and zooplankton material in the organic matter (OM) of this area. Fossil and detrital algal contributions were the major fractions of the freshwater SPM from the Mackenzie River with {\~ }34\% each of the total molecular biomarkers. Fresh algal, C3 terrestrial, bacterial and zooplanktonic components represented much lower percentages, 17, 10, 4 and 80\%), with a minor contribution of fossil and C3 terrestrial biomarkers. Characterization of the sediments revealed a major sink of refractory algal material mixed with some fresh algal material, fossil hydrocarbons and a small input of C3 terrestrial sources. In particular, the sediments from the shelf and at the mouth of the Amundsen Gulf presented the highest contribution of detrital algal material (60\textendash 75\%), whereas those from the slope contained the highest proportion of fossil (40\%) and C3 terrestrial plant material (10\%). Overall, considering that the detrital algal material is marine derived, autochthonous sources contributed more than allochthonous sources to the OM lipid pool. Using the ratio of an allochthonous biomarker (normalized to total organic carbon, TOC) found in the sediments to those measured at the river mouth water, we estimated that the fraction of terrestrial material preserved in the sediments accounted for 30\textendash 40\% of the total carbon in the inner shelf sediments, 17\% in the outer shelf and Amundsen Gulf and up to 25\% in the slope sediments. These estimates are low compared to other studies conducted 5\textendash 20 yr earlier, and they support the increase in primary production during the last decade mainly because of the increase in the number of ice-free days and due to the strength and persistence of winds favouring upwelling.}

  abstract = {Apparent quantum yields and rates of dimethylsulfide (DMS) photolysis were determined from Sargasso Sea seawater with the goal of assessing the extent to which photoreactions affect the unusually elevated upper ocean concentrations of DMS during the summer, the so-called DMS summer paradox. Apparent quantum yields determined with monochromatic radiation decrease exponentially with increasing wavelength and indicate that DMS photolysis is driven by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The relative spectral partitioning differs between samples collected from the surface mixed layer (15 m) and from the chlorophyll a maximum (80 m), presumably because of differences in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) quality (e.g., apparent degree of bleaching). Quantum yields are also temperature dependent, and an approximate doubling of photolysis rates occurs for a 208C increase in temperature. The significance of DMS photolysis to upper ocean sulfur budgets is explored using a multiyear (1992\textendash{} 1994) DMS time series, concurrent irradiance determinations and temperature profiles, and estimates of CDOM absorption. Depth-integrated, mixed-layer DMS photolysis rates peak in the summer (15\textendash 25 mmol m22 d21) and decline to ,1 mmol m22 d21 in the winter. These rates correspond to specific turnover rates of ;0.29 d21 in the summer and ,0.02 d21 in the winter. Seasonal changes in solar radiation, temperature, and DMS concentrations drive the 30-fold differences in photolysis rates, overshadowing differences caused by photosensitizer (CDOM) quantity or quality (21\textendash 35\%). These results demonstrate that although photolysis is not the primary driver of the summer paradox, it makes an important contribution to the time\textendash depth pattern of DMS concentrations observed in the Sargasso Sea.},

  abstract = {In settings where the transport of sand is partially or fully supply limited, changes in the upstream supply of sand are coupled to changes in the grain size of sand on the bed. In this manner, the transport of sand under the supply-limited case is ' grain-size regulated '. Since the closure of Glen Canyon Dam in 1963, the downstream reach of the Colorado River in Marble and Grand Canyons has exhibited evidence of sand-supply limitation. Sand transport in the river is now approximately equally regulated by changes in the discharge of water and changes in the grain sizes of sand on the channel bed and eddy sandbars. Previous work has shown that changes in the grain size of sand on the bed of the channel (driven by changes in the upstream supply of sand owing to both tributary floods and high dam releases) are important in regulating sand transport over timescales of days to months. In this study, suspended-sand data are analysed in conjunction with bed grain-size data to determine whether changes in the grain size of sand on the bed of the channel or changes in the grain size of sand on the surface of eddy sandbars have been more important in regulating sand transport in the post-dam Colorado River over longer, multi-year timescales. The results of this study show that this combined theory- and field-based approach can be used to deduce which environments in a complicated setting are the most important environments for regulating sediment transport. In the case of the regulated Colorado River in Marble and Upper Grand Canyons, suspended-sand transport has been regulated mostly by changes in the surface grain size of eddy sandbars.},

  abstract = {Recently, different algorithms have been developed to assess near-surface particulate organic matter (POC) concentration over coastal waters. In this study, we gathered an extensive in situ dataset representing various contrasted bio-optical coastal environments at low, medium, and high latitudes, with various bulk particulate matter chemical compositions (mineral-dominated, 50\% of the data set, mixed, 40\%, or organic-dominated, 10\%). The dataset includes 606 coincident measurements of POC concentration and remote-sensing reflectance, Rrs, with POC concentrations covering three orders of magnitude. Twelve existing algorithms have then been tested on this data set, and a new one was proposed. The results show that the performance of historical algorithms depends on the type of water, with an overall low performance observed for mineral-dominated waters. Furthermore, none of the tested algorithms provided satisfactory results over the whole POC range. A novel approach was thus developed based on a maximum band ratio of Rrs (red/blue, red/yellow or red/green ratio). Based on the standard statistical metric for the evaluation of inverse models, the new algorithm presents the best performance. The root-mean square deviation for log-transformed data (RMSDlog) is 0.25. The mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) is 37.48\%. The mean bias (MB) and median ratio (MR) values are 0.54 {$\mu$}g L-1 and 1.02, respectively. This algorithm replicates quite well the distribution of in situ data. The new algorithm was also tested on a matchup dataset gathering 154 coincident MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) Rrs and in situ POC concentration sampled along the French coast. The matchup analysis showed that the performance of the new algorithm is satisfactory (RMSDlog = 0.24, MAPD = 34.16\%, MR = 0.92). A regional illustration of the model performance for the Louisiana continental shelf shows that monthly mean POC concentrations derived from MERIS with the new algorithm are consistent with those derived from the 2016 algorithm of Le et al. which was specifically developed for this region.},

Colloids of {$>$}0.02 mum constituted a larger fraction of the exudates originating from ingested bacteria, compared with exudates derived from primary production. Flagellate feeding on bacteria specifically labeled in different cell components was compared. Cell wall components gave rise to less colloidal organic carbon than did other cell constituents. To investigate the degradability of flagellate C-exudates, they were added to lake water and mineralization to CO(2) was monitored. Bacterially derived exudates were more recalcitrant than exudates originating from photosynthesis. The results support the hypothesis that bacterial utilization of labile organic compounds, followed by flagellate bacterivory and exudation, results in a transformation of labile organic matter into more recalcitrant forms.},

We compared the effects of UV radiation on the bacterial use of DOM in a wide range of lakes. Although complex DOM was converted in all irradiated samples into carboxylic acids that are readily utilized by bacteria, irradiation in several lakes resulted in a decreased ability of DOM to support bacterial growth. The effect of irradiation on the ability of DOM to promote bacterial growth was a positive function of the terrestrial humic matter, and a negative function of indigenous algal production. We suggest that the net effect of irradiation is a result of counteracting but concurrent processes rendering DOM either labile or recalcitrant. Humic DOM is predominantly transformed into forms of increased lability, whereas photochemical transformation into compounds of decreased bacterial substrate quality dominates in algal-derived DOM. Hence, solar-induced photochemical reactions interact with microbial degraders in different ways, depending on the origin and nature of the organic matter, affecting the transfer of energy within aquatic food webs, as well as the degradation and preservation of detrital organic matter, in different directions.},

Furthermore, we project changes as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of lakes in the biosphere, and we revise the estimate for the global extent of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may be changed by human activities, including construction of impoundments, which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle, (2) their contribution to this cycle has significantly changed as a result of human activities, and (3) they will continue to change in response to future climate change causing decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases in the number of aquatic impoundments.},

The concentrations and elemental stoichiometry of particulate and dissolved pools of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and silicon (Si) on the Canadian Beaufort Shelf during summer 2009 (MALINA program) were assessed and compared with those of surface waters provided by the Mackenzie river as well as by winter mixing and upwelling of upper halocline waters at the shelf break. Neritic surface waters showed a clear enrichment in dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively), nitrate, total particulate nitrogen (TPN) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) originating from the river. Silicate as well as bulk DON and DOC declined in a near-conservative manner away from the delta's outlet, whereas nitrate dropped non-conservatively to very low background concentrations inside the brackish zone. By contrast, the excess of soluble reactive P (SRP) present in oceanic waters declined in a non-conservative manner toward the river outlet, where concentrations were very low and consistent with P shortage in the Mackenzie River. These opposite gradients imply that the admixture of Pacific-derived, SRP-rich water is necessary to allow phytoplankton to use river-derived nitrate and to a lesser extent DON. A coarse budget based on concurrent estimates of primary production shows that river N deliveries support a modest fraction of primary production when considering the entire shelf, due to the ability of phytoplankton to thrive in the subsurface chlorophyll maximum beneath the thin, nitrate-depleted river plume. Away from shallow coastal bays, local elevations in the concentration of primary production and dissolved organic constituents were consistent with upwelling at the shelf break. By contrast with shallow winter mixing, nutrient deliveries by North American rivers and upwelling relax surface communities from N limitation and permit a more extant utilization of the excess SRP entering through the Bering Strait. In this context, increased nitrogen supply by rivers and upwelling potentially alters the vertical distribution of the excess P exported into the North Atlantic.},

We describe a laboratory experiment carried out in artificial streams, which supports this hypothesis. Periphyton {$\delta$} \textsuperscript{13}C and {$\delta$} \textsuperscript{15}N signatures were significantly depleted in \textsuperscript{13}C and \textsuperscript{15}N when grown at higher water velocity over the range of 5-62 cm s\textsuperscript{-1}, the normal range found in small streams. {$\delta$} \textsuperscript{13}C signatures ranged between -16.7\textperthousand{} and -28.1\textperthousand{} from the lowest to the highest water velocity, respectively. Similarly, {$\delta$} \textsuperscript{15}N signatures ranged between 7.2\textperthousand{} and 2.3\textperthousand{} from the lowest to the highest water velocity, respectively. This pattern was found for algal communities growing on glass (mainly diatoms) as well as for those growing on rock (mainly filamentous green algae). For both C and N, the slopes of the responses were not different between the periphyton communities growing on each substrate, although the effect was statistically weaker for the communities on rocks. The intercept for {$\delta$} \textsuperscript{13}C was significantly higher for the communities on rocks, but not different for {$\delta$} \textsuperscript{15}N. Thus, while both isotopes are fractionated to a greater extent as velocity increases, the diatom communities growing on glass appeared to fractionate C isotopes more than the filamentous green algae growing on rock. This relationship between the stable isotopic signatures of aquatic plants and water velocity will hopefully allow a better understanding of the differences in isotopic signatures of fish in different habitats.},

Here, we synthesize the best available information and develop inventory models to simulate abrupt thaw impacts on permafrost carbon balance. Emissions across 2.5 million km2 of abrupt thaw could provide a similar climate feedback as gradual thaw emissions from the entire 18 million km2 permafrost region under the warming projection of Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. While models forecast that gradual thaw may lead to net ecosystem carbon uptake under projections of Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, abrupt thaw emissions are likely to offset this potential carbon sink. Active hillslope erosional features will occupy 3\% of abrupt thaw terrain by 2300 but emit one-third of abrupt thaw carbon losses. Thaw lakes and wetlands are methane hot spots but their carbon release is partially offset by slowly regrowing vegetation. After considering abrupt thaw stabilization, lake drainage and soil carbon uptake by vegetation regrowth, we conclude that models considering only gradual permafrost thaw are substantially underestimating carbon emissions from thawing permafrost.}

  abstract = {We test the hypothesis that phytoplankton biomass decrease upon entry into the St. Lawrence River from headwaters in Lake Ontario is attributable to a range of causal factors including, decreased photosynthetic fitness due to turbulence, cell loss due to increased flocculation and subsequent sedimentation, decreases in nutrients, and loss due to grazing. In order to test this, changes in phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton concentrations were examined during four transects along the river, from 8 km offshore in Lake Ontario to the hydroelectric power dam 180 km downstream. Both phytoplankton biomass, measured as chlorophyll-a, and zooplankton decreased markedly upon entry of lake water into the river. Phytoplankton community composition and size changed little over the river reach and tended to reflect that in Lake Ontario. Total phosphorus increased with transit of river water downstream despite low tributary inputs of water into this reach of river. Light availability was high, photosynthetic efficiency suggested that phytoplankton were not physiologically stressed during transit in turbulent waters, and there was no direct evidence of flocculation causing sedimentation of phytoplankton. Grazing by the benthic community (filtering insect larvae and dreissenid mussels) is inferred to be a dominant biological factor as is the geomorphology in this reach of the river, which includes large littoral areas, shoals, and reaches of high water velocity that can increase particle contact in the water column with benthic grazers. The findings of this study have a bearing on understanding how changing water levels in a regulated river might alter areas of benthic grazing.},

  abstract = {The present study examines the potential of using the near-surface chlorophyll a conkentration ([Chla]surf), as it can be derived from ocean color observation, to infer the column-integrated phytoplankton biomass, its vertical distribution, and ultimately the community composition. Within this context, a large High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) pigment database was analyzed. It includes 2419 vertical pigment profiles, sampled in case 1 waters with various trophic states (0.03-6 mg Chla m-3). The relationships between [Chla]surf and the chlorophyll a vertical distribution, as previously derived by Morel and Berthon (1989), are fully confirmed. This agreement makes it possible to go further and to examine if similar relationships between [Chla]surf and the phytoplankton assemblage composition along the vertical can be derived. Thanks to the detailed pigment composition, and use of specific pigment biomarkers, the contribution to the local chlorophyll a concentration of three phytoplankton groups can be assessed. With some cautions, these groups coincide with three size classes, i.e., microplankton, nanoplankton and picoplankton. Corroborating previous regional findings (e.g., large species dominate in eutrophic environments, whereas tiny phytoplankton prevail in oligotrophic zones), the present results lead to an empirical parameterization applicable to most oceanic waters. The predictive skill of this parameterization is satisfactorily tested on a separate data set. With such a tool, the vertical chlorophyll a profiles of each group can be inferred solely from the knowledge of [Chla]surf. By combining this tool with satellite ocean color data, it becomes possible to quantify on a global scale the phytoplankton biomass associated with each of the three algal assemblages.

In the outer archipelago of the Baltic the selection of unexposed spawning sites can be explained by the genetic component in larval dispersal and the return to inshore waters. The larvae were found to be active, at least in initiating the dispersal. Nevertheless, currents probably aid in the dispersal process. Although the shift back inshore has been documented in all lakes studied, it was here noted to be a gradual process. The timing of the return to littoral areas varies somewhat from one lake to another, and it may also depend on the size and trophic state of the lake. Perch thus appears to be adapted to variable environments. It is suggested that the shift may be a sensitive period in the formation of year-class strength, since the 0+ perch are then more exposed to predator pressure. The dispersal strategies of roach and perch larvae differed, and only after perch returned to the littoral did the distribution area of 0+ perch overlap with that of 0+ roach.}

  abstract = {The amount of information available to run a spatially distributed model is often very much less than the ideal. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of degradation of information about the spatial distribution of input parameters, and second the scale at which this information is obtained. A well defined agricultural catchment, with an important database concerning spatial and temporal observations has been used for this purpose: the agricultural catchment of la Cote St Andre, 60 km North East of Grenoble in the South East of France. The methodological framework is based on the Areal Non-point Source Watershed Environmental Response Simulation model. A 3 year simulation using georeferenced variables (crops and soil types) and annual changes in crop rotation is first developed as a reference. This is compared to simulations results obtained during the same period, with the same climatic data, but with the following degradation of quality of other inputs: firstly, the spatial distribution of soils and crop is ignored; both variables being defined by their areal coverage obtained from local information; secondly, the same inputs are deduced from a database obtained at the European scale. In both cases, a Latin Hypercube Sampler is used to stochastically generate sets of samples corresponding to the probability distribution of variables. The study is based on comparisons between modelled outputs: drainage of water and leaching of nitrate below the root zone of crops at the catchment scale. When information is local, and in absence of lateral flow (runoff), distributed modelling and purely stochastic modelling provide identical catchment average values; on the contrary, the use of the European database may introduce important biases concerning the proportion of land uses and of soils. In both cases, however, the lack of information concerning the location of sensitive areas in terms of risks of pollution may be considered as an important weakness of stochastic models.

The rate of mineralization decreased with increasing depth with an attenuation coefficient of 23 m(-1). Consequently most photochemical mineralization in the water column (0.99 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) took place in the top 10 cm. The rate of photochemical mineralization was also modeled as a product of three spectra: (1) scalar photon flux density, (2) the apparent quantum yield (phi(lambda)), and (3) the absorption of chromophoric dissolved organic matter. We described the spectrum for apparent quantum yield as phi(lambda) = c x 10(-d lambda), where c (dimensionless) and d (nm(-1)) are positive constants. Mathematical optimization for the best fit between the measured and the modeled photochemical mineralization resulted in phi(lambda) of 7.52 X 10(-0.0122 lambda). The phi(A) based on the measurements in situ agreed with phi(lambda) determined in a laboratory at 320, 355, and 390 nm. Using the determined phi(lambda), we calculated that UV-B contributed 9\%, UV-A 68\%, and visible light 23\% to the photochemical mineralization. Half of total photochemical mineralization was due to wavelengths {$<$}360 mm. Our method for the determination of phi(lambda) is applicable in situ, improves the prediction of photochemical reaction rates in surface waters, and offers an alternative to the determination of quantum yields at discrete wavelengths.},

During 70-day exposure, solar radiation decomposed 96\% of freshwater CDOM but only 41\% of DOC. Apparent quantum yields for photochemical decomposition decreased in proportion to the dose of absorbed photons by CDOM. When apparent quantum yield for photochemical decomposition of CDOM was applied to an optical model, it revealed that solar UV radiation was responsible for 75\% and 44\% of the decomposition of CDOM at the surface and in the whole water column, respectively. The modeled rates of photochemical decomposition were in good agreement with the measurements in a 2-m deep photolytic stratum. The photochemical decomposition of CDOM attenuated in the water column similarly to violet-blue irradiance. During 500-day long incubations in darkness, plankton decomposed CDOM as much as was decomposed at the surface by solar radiation in a week. Thus, solar radiation was much more important than plankton in the decomposition of CDOM at the surface. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The photochemical transformation of DOM increased the biomass and the production of heterotrophic bacteria, flagellates, and ciliates in the following 10 d bioassay. The succession of heterotrophic plankton indicated a 3-level trophic transfer of photoproduced bioavailable DOM through bacteria and flagellates to ciliates. The photochemical transformation of DOM also stimulated the biomass and the production of phytoplankton through the photoproduction of bioavailable N initially incorporated into bacterial biomass. The grazing of bacterioplankton supplied N to phytoplankton directly, presumably due to mixotrophy, and indirectly by releasing dissolved N. The carbon stable isotope signature of plankton biomass was similar to that of allochthonous carbon, indicating that the photochemical transformations concerned primarily terrestrial DOM and therefore represented a microbial link between terrestrial DOM and planktonic production. The bacterial production stimulated by the photochemically produced labile DOM was related to the number of photons absorbed during the photochemical transformation of DOM for the determination of apparent quantum yield. According to the apparent quantum yield, the calculated summertime photoproduction of labile substrates contributes 2 to 5\% to total bacterial production in the northern Baltic Sea. According to this study, the photochemical transformation of terrestrial DOM influences not only the initial production of bacterioplankton but can also stimulate higher trophic levels and autotrophic plankton in coastal waters.},

  abstract = {Abstract. A global compilation of in situ data is useful to evaluate the quality of ocean-colour satellite data records. Here we describe the data compiled for the validation of the ocean-colour products from the ESA Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI). The data were acquired from several sources (including, inter alia, MOBY, BOUSSOLE, AERONET-OC, SeaBASS, NOMAD, MERMAID, AMT, ICES, HOT and GeP\&amp;CO) and span the period from 1997 to 2018. Observations of the following variables were compiled: spectral remote-sensing reflectances, concentrations of chlorophyll~a, spectral inherent optical properties, spectral diffuse attenuation coefficients and total suspended matter. The data were from multi-project archives acquired via open internet services or from individual projects, acquired directly from data providers. Methodologies were implemented for homogenization, quality control and merging of all data. No changes were made to the original data, other than averaging of observations that were close in time and space, elimination of some points after quality control and conversion to a standard format. The final result is a merged table designed for validation of satellite-derived ocean-colour products and available in text format. Metadata of each in situ measurement (original source, cruise or experiment, principal investigator) was propagated throughout the work and made available in the final table. By making the metadata available, provenance is better documented, and it is also possible to analyse each set of data separately. This paper also describes the changes that were made to the compilation in relation to the previous version (Valente et al., 2016).

Relationships between sea surface temperature (SST, {$>$} 10 m) and vertical density stratification, nutrient concentrations, and phytoplankton biomass, composition, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) specific absorption were assessed in spring and summer from latitudes 29 to 63\textdegree{} N in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. The goal of this study was to identify relationships between phytoplankton and abiotic factors in an existing SST and stratification gradient. Furthermore, a bio-optical model was used to estimate productivity for five phytoplankton groups. Nutrient concentration (integrated from 0 to 125 m) was inversely correlated with SST in spring and summer. SST was also inversely correlated with near-surface (0\textendash 50 m) Chl a and productivity for stratified stations. Near-surface Chl a and productivity showed exponential relationships with SST. Chl a specific absorption and excess light experiments indicated photoacclimation to lower irradiance in spring as compared to summer. In addition, Chl a specific absorption suggested that phytoplankton size decreased in summer. The contribution of cyanobacteria to water column productivity of stratified stations correlated positively with SST and inversely with nutrient concentration. This suggests that a rise in SST (over a 13\textendash 23 \textdegree C range) stimulates productivity by cyanobacteria at the expense of haptophytes, which showed an inverse relationship to SST. At higher latitudes, where rising SST may prolong the stratified season, haptophyte productivity may expand at the expense of diatom productivity. Depth-integrated Chl a (0\textendash 410 m) was greatest in the spring at higher latitudes, where stratification in the upper 200 m was weakest. This suggests that stronger stratification does not necessarily result in higher phytoplankton biomass standing stock in this region.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The energy budget of Arctic sea ice is strongly affected by the snow cover. Intensive sampling of snow properties was conducted near Qikiqtarjuak in Baffin Bay on typical landfast sea ice during two melt seasons in 2015 and 2016. The sampling included stratigraphy, vertical profiles of snow specific surface area (SSA), density and surface spectral albedo. Both seasons feature four main phases: I) dry snow cover, II) surface melting, III) ripe snowpack and IV) melt pond formation. Each of them was characterized by distinctive physical and optical properties. Highest SSA of 49.3\&thinsp;m2\&thinsp;kg\&minus;1 was measured during phase I on surface windslab together with a high broadband albedo of 0.87. The next phase was marked by alternative episodes of surface melting which dramatically decreased the SSA below 3\&thinsp;m2\&thinsp;kg\&minus;1 and episodes of snowfall reestablishing the pre-melt conditions. Albedo was highly time variable especially in the near-infrared with minimum values around 0.45 at 1000\&thinsp;nm. At some point, the melt progressed leading to a fully ripe snowpack composed of clustered rounded grains in phase III. Albedo began to decrease in the visible as snow thickness decreased but remained steady at longer wavelengths. Moreover, its spatial variability clearly appeared for the first time following snow depth heterogeneity. The impacts on albedo of both snow SSA and thickness were quantitatively investigated using a radiative transfer model. Comparisons between albedo measurements and simulations show that our data on snow physical properties are relevant for radiative transfer modeling. They also point out to the importance of the properties of the very surface snow layer for albedo computation, especially during phase II when several distinctive layers of snow superimposed following snowfalls, melt or diurnal cycles.}

We have used the paleolimnological top\textendash bottom approach to reconstruct changes in whole-lake macrophyte biomass between predisturbance and present-day conditions in 37 southern Quebec lakes. Estimates of whole-lake macrophyte biomass were produced using a diatom-based multivariate regression tree model (MRT) and modern analogue approach. Both approaches indicated an overall pattern of declining macrophyte abundance in the region. Based on MRT analysis, 80\% of study lakes were classified as historically being in the macrophyte-dominated state, but now only 43\% of the lakes are currently in this state. The lakes that shifted MRT group were found to have significantly (p = 0.03) greater building densities in their catchments compared with lakes that did not shift state.

  abstract = {[1] This paper seeks to determine the impact of extreme phases of the Southern Oscillation ( SO, El Nino/ La Nina) on droughts in the Iberian Peninsula. For this purpose, 51 precipitation series ( 1910 - 2000) were used. A spatial classification based on monthly precipitation records was made to identify homogeneous regions and to analyze any spatial differences in the influence of these extreme phases. For each region a drought index was calculated ( standardized precipitation index) at timescales of 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. El Nino and La Nina years were identified using the Southern Oscillation index (SOI), in line with studies conducted elsewhere. Mean values of the drought index were calculated each month for the four timescales during El Nino and La Nina years as well as for the year following these events. The statistical significance of any anomalies was evaluated by means of the nonparametric Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test. The results indicate that extreme phases of the SO significantly affect the occurrence of droughts in the Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, spatial and temporal differences, depending on the timescale used, were identified. Large areas of the Iberian Peninsula are affected by significant negative values of SPI during the final months of La Nina years and the initial months of the following year. In contrast, other areas are affected by dry conditions during the first months of El Nino years as well as during the summers and autumns of the following year. The spatial differences in drought conditions during extreme phases of the SO are noticeable, and the drought signal is more consistent for La Nina than it is for El Nino years. Finally, the usefulness of these results for drought prediction and early warning systems is discussed.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices.},

The downstream reach of such environments, in particular the freshwater-saltwater transition zone (FSTZ), is a critical ecotone for the entire river system and is highly sensitive to each of these anthropogenic effects. The FSTZ integrates upstream and downstream processes, is one of the most biologically productive sections of the river, and is a prime site for monitoring fluvial and estuarine health.},

Spatially-explicit estimates of whole-system production were obtained by combining field measurements with remotely sensed data and empirical models using GIS. Primary production and relative contributions of each producer type differed markedly between open-water and wetland habitats. Spatial differences within each habitat arose from interactions between physical factors including light, water depth, water transit times and wind stress. At the whole-system level, annual primary production represented 105 gC m(-2) y(-1), divided roughly equally among phytoplankton (34\%), submerged macrophytes (27\%), emergent macrophytes (23\%) and epiphyton (16\%). A 10\% decrease in annual flows and 1-m decline in water levels between 2000 and 2001 resulted in a 50\% loss of marsh habitat, a 60\% increase in phytoplankton production in the open-water zone, and in the appearance of conspicuous filamentous algal mats. Low water levels induced substantial shifts in the spatial configuration and relative importance of primary producers although total river primary production remained stable between years.},

Then inverse solutions are presented that enhance the standard data processing by adding external constraints such as bottom-referenced velocity profiles.

It is, however, unclear how we should interpret these shifts without some sort of a yardstick: a measure that will reflect how much a species should be shifting to match the change in its environment caused by climate change. Here, we assume that the shift in the phenology of a species' food abundance is, by a first approximation, an appropriate yardstick. We review the few examples that are available, ranging from birds to marine plankton. In almost all of these examples, the phenology of the focal species shifts either too little (five out of 11) or too much (three out of 11) compared to the yardstick. Thus, many species are becoming mistimed due to climate change. We urge researchers with long-term datasets on phenology to link their data with those that may serve as a yardstick, because documentation of the incidence of climate change-induced mistiming is crucial in assessing the impact of global climate change on the natural world.},

  abstract = {Climate warming in northeastern Siberia may induce thaw-mobilization of the organic carbon (OC) now held in permafrost. This study investigated the composition of terrestrial OC exported to Arctic coastal waters to both obtain a natural integration of terrestrial permafrost OC release and to further understand the fate of released carbon in the extensive Siberian Shelf Seas. Application of a variety of elemental, molecular and isotopic ({$\delta$}13C and {$\Delta$}14C) analyses of both surface water suspended particulate matter and underlying surface sediments along a 500 km transect from Kolyma River mouth to the mid-shelf of the East Siberian Sea yielded information on the sources, degradation status and transport processes of thaw-mobilized soil OC. A three end-member dual-carbon-isotopic mixing model was applied to deduce the relative contributions from riverine, coastal erosion and marine sources. The mixing model was solved numerically using Monte Carlo simulations to obtain a fair representation of the uncertainties of both end-member composition and the end results. Riverine OC contributions to sediment OC decrease with increasing distance offshore (35{$\pm$}15 to 13{$\pm$}9\%), whereas coastal erosion OC exhibits a constantly high contribution (51{$\pm$}11 to 60{$\pm$}12\%) and marine OC increases offshore (9{$\pm$}7 to 36{$\pm$}10\%). We attribute the remarkably strong imprint of OC from coastal erosion, extending up to {$\sim$}500 km from the coast, to efficient offshoreward transport in these shallow waters presumably through both the benthic boundary layer and ice-rafting. There are also indications of simultaneous selective preservation of erosion OC compared to riverine OC. Molecular degradation proxies and radiocarbon contents indicated a degraded but young ({$\Delta$}14C ca. -60\% or ca. 500 14C years) terrestrial OC pool in surface water particulate matter, underlain by a less degraded but old ({$\Delta$}14C ca. -500\% or ca. 5500 14C years) terrestrial OC pool in bottom sediments. We suggest that the terrestrial OC fraction in surface water particulate matter is mainly derived from surface soil and recent vegetation fluvially released as buoyant organic-rich aggregates (e.g., humics), which are subjected to extensive processing during coastal transport. In contrast, terrestrial OC in the underlying sediments is postulated to originate predominantly from erosion of mineral-rich Pleistocene coasts (i.e., yedoma) and inland mineral soils. Sorptive association of this organic matter with mineral particles protects the OC from remineralization and also promotes rapid settling (ballasting) of the OC. Our findings corroborate recent studies by indicating that different Arctic surface soil OC pools exhibit distinguishing susceptibilities to degradation in coastal waters. Consequently, the general postulation of a positive feedback to global warming from degradation of permafrost carbon may be both attenuated (by reburial of one portion) and geographically displaced (degradation of released terrestrial permafrost OC far out over the Arctic shelf seas). \textcopyright{} Author(s) 2010.}

  abstract = {The future trajectory of greenhouse gas concentrations depends on interactions between climate and the biogeosphere. Thawing of Arctic permafrost could release significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere in this century. Ancient Ice Complex deposits outcropping along the g\^\^1/47,000- kilometre-long coastline of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), and associated shallow subsea permafrost, are two large pools of permafrost carbon, yet their vulnerabilities towards thawing and decomposition are largely unknown. Recent Arctic warming is stronger than has been predicted by several degrees, and is particularly pronounced over the coastal ESAS region. There is thus a pressing need to improve our understanding of the links between permafrost carbon and climate in this relatively inaccessible region. Here we show that extensive release of carbon from these Ice Complex deposits dominates (57\^g\texteuro\textperthousand{} {$\pm$}\^g\texteuro\textperthousand 2 per cent) the sedimentary carbon budget of the ESAS, the world\^g\texteuro\texttrademark s largest continental shelf, overwhelming the marine and topsoil terrestrial components.

We estimate that about two-thirds (66\^g\texteuro\textperthousand{} {$\pm$}\^g\texteuro\textperthousand 16 per cent) of this old carbon escapes to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, with the remainder being re-buried in shelf sediments. Thermal collapse and erosion of these carbon-rich Pleistocene coastline and seafloor deposits may accelerate with Arctic amplification of climate warming. \textcopyright{} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {The rapidly changing East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) receives large amounts of terrestrial organic carbon (OC) from coastal erosion and Russian-Arctic rivers. Climate warming increases thawing of coastal Ice Complex Deposits (ICD) and can change both the amount of released OC, as well as its propensity to be converted to greenhouse gases (fueling further global warming) or to be buried in coastal sediments. This study aimed to unravel the susceptibility to degradation, and transport and dispersal patterns of OC delivered to the ESAS. Bulk and molecular radiocarbon analyses on surface particulate matter (PM), sinking PM and underlying surface sediments illustrate the active release of old OC from coastal permafrost. Molecular tracers for recalcitrant soil OC showed ages of 3.4-13 14C-ky in surface PM and 5.5-18 14C-ky in surface sediments. The age difference of these markers between surface PM and surface sediments is larger (i) in regions with low OC accumulation rates, suggesting a weaker exchange between water column and sediments, and (ii) with increasing distance from the Lena River, suggesting preferential settling of fluvially derived old OC nearshore. A dual-carbon end-member mixing model showed that (i) contemporary terrestrial OC is dispersed mainly by horizontal transport while being subject to active degradation, (ii) marine OC is most affected by vertical transport and also actively degraded in the water column, and (iii) OC from ICD settles rapidly and dominates surface sediments. Preferential burial of ICD-OC released into ESAS coastal waters might therefore lower the suggested carbon cycle climate feedback from thawing ICD permafrost.},

Stable isotope analysis suggests that most of the settling organic matter is of allochthonous origin. Annual sedimentation of allochthonous matter per m(2) lake area was correlated to DOC concentration in the water (R-2 = 0.41), and the relationship was improved when sedimentation data were normalized to water depth (R-2 = 0.58). The net efflux of C as CO2 from the water to the atmosphere was likewise correlated to DOC concentration (R-2 = 0.52). The losses of organic carbon from the water column via mineralization to CO2 and via sedimentation were approximately of equal importance throughout the year. Our results imply that DOC is a precursor of the settling matter, resulting in an important pathway in the carbon cycle of boreal lakes. Thus, flocculation of DOC of terrestrial origin and subsequent sedimentation could lead to carbon sequestration by burial in lake sediments.},

Both zooplankton species had a negative effect on Rhodomonas net specific growth rate due to grazing and a positive effect on specific primary production due to nutrient regeneration. Daphnia had no effect on bacterial net specific growth rate, bacterial production or specific bacterial production in one of two experiments. In the other experiment, however, both bacterial growth rate and production decreased as a result of grazing. Furthermore, Daphnia had a negative effect on specific bacterial production, but Eudiaptomus had a positive effect on all bacterial parameters due to nutrient regeneration, probably of phosphorus. Positive effects of copepods on bacterial growth has previously been attributed to trophic cascades via protozoa. However, the present experiments show that regeneration of nutrients, especially phosphorus, may account for a large part of the stimulation of bacterial growth.},

Biodiversity is taken to be the integration of biological variability across all scales, from the genetic, through species and ecosystems, to landscapes. Conserving biodiversity is a daunting task, and the paper asserts that focusing on species is not the best approach. The best way to minimize species loss is to maintain the integrity of ecosystem function. The important questions therefore concern the kinds of biodiversity that are significant to ecosystem functioning. To best focus our efforts we need to establish how much (or how little) redundancy there is in the biological composition of ecosystems. An approach is suggested, based on the use of functional groups of organisms defined according to ecosystem processes. Functional groups with little or no redundancy warrant priority conservation effort. Complementary species-based approaches for maximizing the inclusion of biodiversity within a set of conservation areas are compared to the functional-group approach.}

A positive linear relationship between four fluorescent components and lignin phenols suggests a terrestrial origin, whereas two components were unrelated to a river source, suggesting an autochthonous source. Elevated concentrations of terrestrial components were observed in the Mackenzie River plume near the coast of Alaska and decreased as water was transported to the Canadian Archipelago. The two nonterrestrial components exhibited only background levels in concentrations along the transect, suggesting minimal productivity within plume and archipelago surface waters. The relative abundance of terrestrial components in relation to nonterrestrial components allowed us to distinguish water masses including Atlantic, Archipelago, and Mackenzie River plume, respectively. This study illustrates the usefulness of PARAFAC to fingerprint water masses based on the optical characteristics of CDOM and shows promise to improve our understanding of upper Arctic Ocean ventilation.},

Very few species were strictly pelagic, and the pelagic crustacean zooplankton species were by far outnumbered by their littoral counterparts. More than two-thirds of the total crustacean species numbers in lakes were accounted for by species with a littoral preference. A considerable number of species occurred with low frequency, and the median total number of crustacean species in the lakes was only 14. A majority of littoral species also occurred commonly in pelagic samples, and vice versa. Some species are truly both littoral and pelagic, and nearly all species occurring in pelagic samples were also common in littoral samples. A high proportion of the common littoral species was only recorded occasionally in pelagic samples, and should thus be considered strictly littoral. There was no significant correlation between lake area and species richness for pelagic or littoral species. Our findings demonstrate the importance of including littoral species when assessing microcrustacean diversity in lakes, and we question the practice of considering species as either pelagic or littoral, because a majority of the recorded species was common in both habitats. It calls for a further discussion of the term "planktonic", since most of the species are at least partly "semiplanktonic."},

We therefore demonstrated that two recently modified primer pairs that target taxonomically discriminatory regions of bacterial and fungal genomic DNA do not introduce new biases when used on a variety of sample types, from soil to human skin.

Furthermore wet chemical analysis (CODCr and BOD5) and measurement of three dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3DEEM) spectra in the laboratory have been conducted. Using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model, three components of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) have been identified successfully, based on the analysis of 3DEEM data. The characteristics of the three components also have been described by comparing them to some components of CDOM, identified in earlier researches. Meanwhile, spatial variations of concentration for the three components in Taihu Lake have been analyzed, and the result indicates that the concentration of component 1 depends more on the situation of wastewater pollution and can be used as the indicator of wastewater pollution. The relationship between the concentrations of the three components and results of the wet chemical analysis show that none of the three components can be used as indicators of gross organic matter in water. However, the concentrations of all the three components have obvious linear relationships with the BOD5 value, especially for component 1 (r = 0.72878). Finally, the potential applications of the composition analysis based on 3DEEM and PARAFAC model in water quality monitoring have been illuminated.},

  abstract = {Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is a critical parameter in the study of river sediment transport and water quality variation, but traditional measurement methods are costly and time-consuming. This paper is focused on presenting a methodology that may be useful in estimating SSC which is of key importance in process geomorphology and hydrology. In previous studies, remote sensing has been applied to estimate the SSC of sea waters as well as low turbid inland waters like lakes, reservoirs and short river reaches visible within a single Landsat satellite image coverage. Rivers, especially highly turbid large rivers, have largely been ignored. The dataset used in this paper includes measured SSC and multi-temporal Landsat ETM+ images covering most part of the Yangtze River. Using an effective easy-to-use atmospheric correction method that does not require in situ atmospheric conditions, retrieved water reflectance of Band 4 was found to be a good SSC indicator within the large SSC range 22-2610 mg l(-1). The newly developed regression relation between SSC and water reflectance of Band 4 appears to be able to provide a relatively accurate SSC estimate directly from Landsat ETM+ images for the Yangtze River from the upper, the middle to the lower reaches. With the relation it is possible to estimate or map out SSC dynamics of large rivers which lack SSC data due to constraints of conventional measurements. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Using a Suntest CPS solar simulator, Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) was photooxidated to examine the effects of O(2) levels, the wavelength of incident light, and the concentration of Fe on the photoproduction of DIC. Increasing the O(2) abundance enhanced photodegradation of SRHA. The rate of DIC photoproduction under air saturation in the first 24 h (4.40 mu mol/(L h)) was increased by a factor of 1.56 under O(2) saturation, but fell by only 36\% under N(2) saturation. To evaluate the relative importance of UV-B, UV-A, and visible radiation in the photodegradation, we examined the above process using Mylar-d films and UF-3 and UF-4 plexiglass filters. The results indicated that the UV-B, UV-A and visible wavelengths accounted for 31.8\%, 32.6\% and 25.6\%, respectively, of DIC production with simulated sunlight irradiation. The above results also indicated that photoproduction of DIC could take place in natural water at depths greater than those that UV light can reach. When 20 mu mol/L desferrioxamine mesylate (DFOM, a strong Fe complexing ligand) was added, the rate of DIC photoproduction fell to 55.6\% that of the original SRHA samples with 5.46 mu mol/L Fe.},

  abstract = {The term riverine landscape implies a holistic geomorphic perspective of the extensive interconnected series of biotopes and environmental gradients that, with their biotic communities, constitute fluvial systems. Natural disturbance regimes maintain multiple interactive pathways (connectivity) across the riverine landscape. Disturbance and environmental gradients, acting in concert, result in a positive feedback between connectivity and spatio-temporal heterogeneity that leads to the broad-scale patterns and processes responsible for high levels of biodiversity. Anthropogenic impacts such as flow regulation, channelization, and bank stabilization, by (1) disrupting natural disturbance regimes, (2) truncating environmental gradients, and (3) severing interactive pathways, eliminate upstream-downstream linkages and isolate river channels from riparian/floodplain systems and contiguous groundwater aquifers. These alterations interfere with successional trajectories, habitat diversification, migratory pathways and other processes, thereby reducing biodiversity. Ecosystem management is necessary to maintain or restore biodiversity at a landscape scale. To be effective, conservation efforts should be based on a solid conceptual foundation and a holistic understanding of natural river ecosystems. Such background knowledge is necessary to re-establish environmental gradients, to reconnect interactive pathways, and to reconstitute some semblance of the natural dynamics responsible for high levels of biodiversity. The challenge for the future lies in protecting the ecological integrity and biodiversity of aquatic systems in the face of increasing pressures on our freshwater resources. This will require integrating sound scientific principles with management perspectives that recognize floodplains and groundwaters as integral components of rivers and that ave based on sustaining, rather than suppressing, environmental heterogeneity.

Therefore, a field investigation to study the hydrography and the phytoplankton composition of the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the central Barents Sea was carried out along a south-north transect in May 1993. The weakly stratified Atlantic sector of the transect appeared to be in a pre-bloom state and had intermittent intrusions from the meandering Polar Front and the Norwegian Coastal Current, introducing water of a more advanced bloom state. Pico- and nanoplankton flagellates and monads dominated, with a few diatoms and Phaeocystis pouchetii colonies. The average new production rate of 26 g C\textperiodcentered m-2 as reflected by NO3 depletion in the euphotic zone, however, indicated that the vernal bloom had been in progress for some time in the Atlantic sector without leaving specific signals in the suspended fraction. The ice-edge and Polar Front area was characterized by a dominance of centric colonial diatom genera Chaetoceros and Thalassiosira with some development of P. pouchetii. In the densely ice-covered and stratified Arctic zone the vernal bloom was at its maximum and dominated by the diatom genera Fragilariopsis and Chaetoceros. Diatoms were limited by silicate concentrations {$<$}2 {$\mu$}M in 32\% of all samples. New production, as revealed by the C equivalent of nitrate depletion in the upper layer, ranged between 12 g C\textperiodcentered m-2 in the north to 45 g C\textperiodcentered m-2 in the meandering Polar Front, with an average of about 27 {$\pm$} 28\% g C\textperiodcentered m-2. The time development of the vernal bloom in the marginal ice zone and the central Barents Sea in late May 1993, with its complicated zonal structure, was not from south to north, but intermittently from north to south. Later during the year the general development of the vernal bloom was, as expected, from south to north.},

This material is further distributed across the Arctic by ocean currents and sea ice. The coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to changes related to recent climate change. We compiled a pan-Arctic review that looks into the changing Holocene sources, transport processes and sinks of terrigenous sediment in the Arctic Ocean. Existing palaeoceanographic studies demonstrate how climate warming and the disappearance of ice sheets during the early Holocene initiated eustatic sea-level rise that greatly modified the physiography of the Arctic Ocean. Sedimentation rates over the shelves and slopes were much greater during periods of rapid sea-level rise in the early and middle Holocene, as a result of the relative distance to the terrestrial sediment sources. However, estimates of suspended sediment delivery through major Arctic rivers do not indicate enhanced delivery during this time, which suggests enhanced rates of coastal erosion. The increased supply of terrigenous material to the outer shelves and deep Arctic Ocean in the early and middle Holocene might serve as analogous to forecast changes in the future Arctic.},

The chapter focuses on the major fraction of organic carbon on the Earth's surface that exists as dissolved substances in seawater. These materials for the most part constitute the waste products of a dynamic cycling between carbon fixation and consumption in the oceans. They include reactive substances categorized broadly as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids as well as biologically resistant heteropolycondensations (humic matter) and degradation products of these primary constituents. Overall, these dissolved substances harbor a myriad of charged sites that can bind trace elements. Because metal availability to microorganisms is in most cases proportional to the free ion concentrations of the metal, organic complexity decreases the immediate availability of nutrient metals. If retained in surface waters, these organic complexes serve to buffer metal ion activities at levels far below the total dissolved metal concentrations and also slow the export of essential metals from the photic zone. Therefore, the cycling and availability of metals to microorganisms is intricately involved with the marine carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a major component of the total dissolved organic matter in seawater, and it can interfere significantly with oceanographic remote sensing in nearshore waters. Coastal marine CDOM comprises an undefined, likely rapidly changing mixture of terrestrially and marine-derived substances. Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (FlFFF) offers a novel approach for separating the colloidal (high molecular weight) fraction of CDOM into broad size continuums that can offer insights to the characteristics and reactivity of CDOM constituents. FlFFF analyses of seawaters in and around the Mississippi Plume were performed during high and low flow conditions and the results compared to analyses of phytoplankton cultures and waters from a coastal estuary having low freshwater inputs. FlFFF fractograms displayed major differences in the size distribution of CDOM between offshore in the Gulf of Mexico (GOMex) and the Mississippi River plume. Colloidal size distributions in nearshore surface waters out of the immediate influence of the Mississippi Plume contained a mixture of features seen in offshore waters, plume waters, and in phytoplankton cultures. Plume waters had a high abundance of larger colloidal phases but continued dilution with coastal waters led to preferential losses of mid-sized colloidal matter. Colloidal size spectra in offshore waters of the GOMex during spring were similar to that observed in estuarine waters after the spring bloom. These preliminary findings suggest that the colloidal size spectrum of CDOM may provide information on its provenance and the relative mixtures of terrestrial and marine components. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Satellite data product validation and algorithm development activities both require the substantial accumulation of high-quality in-situ observations. The NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group maintains a local repository of in-situ marine bio-optical data, the SeaWiFS Biooptical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS), to facilitate their ocean color satellite validation analyses. Data were acquired from SeaBASS and used to compile a large set of coincident radiometric observations and phytoplankton pigment concentrations for use in biooptical algorithm development. This new data set, the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD), includes over 3400 stations of spectral water-leaving radiances, surface irradiances, and diffuse downwelling attenuation coefficients, encompassing chlorophyll a concentrations ranging from 0.012 to 72.12 mg m(-3). Metadata, such as the date, time, and location of data collection, and ancillary data, including sea surface temperatures and water depths, accompany each record. This paper describes the assembly and evaluation of NOMAD, and further illustrates the broad geophysical range of stations incorporated into NOMAD. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {While both aqueous bromine (HOBr/OBr-) and chlorine (HOCl/OCl-) react with natural organic matter (NOM) during water treatment, limited direct parallel comparison of bromine versus chlorine has been conducted. Experiments with model compounds and natural waters indicated more efficient substitution reactions with bromine than chlorine. Kinetic experiments with NOM isolates with and without pre-ozonation were conducted to obtain second-order rate constants (k) with bromine and chlorine. Two-stage reaction kinetics (rapid initial and slower consumption stages) were observed. Bromine reacted about 10 times faster than chlorine with NOM isolates during both stages. The rapid initial stage reactions were too fast to quantify k values, but qualitative estimates ranged between 500 and 5000M -1s-1. For the slower second stage k values for bromine were 15 to 167M-1s-1 over the pH range of 5-11, and lower for chlorine (k = 0.7-5M-1s-1). Values of k correlated with initial SUVA values of NOM (UVA measured at 254nm divided by DOC). Based upon UV/VIS and solid-state 13C-NMR spectroscopy, chlorine addition to a NOM isolate resulted in significant oxidation of aromatic and ketone groups while bromine had significantly less change in spectra. Overall, the improved knowledge that bromine reacts faster and substitutes more efficiently than chlorine will be useful in developing strategies to control disinfection by-product formation during water treatment. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Numerous studies have estimated carbon exchanges at the land\textendash atmosphere interface, more recently also including estimates at the freshwater\textendash atmosphere interface. Less attention has been paid to lateral carbon fluxes, in particular to the fate of terrestrial carbon during transport from soils via surface waters to the sea. Using extensive datasets on soil, lake and river mouth chemistry of the boreal/hemiboreal region we determined organic carbon (OC) stocks of the O horizon from catchment soils, annual OC transports through more than 700 lakes (OClakeflux) and the total annual OC transport at Sweden's 53 river mouths (OCseaflux). We show here that a minimum of 0.03\textendash 0.87\% yr-1 of the OC soil stocks need to be exported to lakes in order to sustain the annual OClakeflux. Across Sweden we estimated a total OClakeflux of {\~ }2.9 Mtonne yr-1, which corresponds to {\~ }10\% of Sweden's total terrestrial net ecosystem production, and it is over 50\% higher than the total OCseaflux. The OC loss during transport to the sea follows a simple exponential decay with an OC half-life of {\~ }12 years. Water colour, a proxy often used for dissolved humic matter, is similarly lost exponentially but about twice as fast as OC. Thus, we found a selective loss of the coloured portion of soil-derived OC during its transport through inland waters, prior to being discharged into the sea. The selective loss is water residence time dependent, resulting in that the faster the water flows through the landscape the less OC and colour is lost. We conclude that increases in runoff will result in less efficient losses of OC, and particularly of colour, if the time for OC transformations in the landscape shortens. Consequently, OC reaching the sea is likely to become more coloured, and less processed, which can have far-reaching effects on biogeochemical cycles.},

Many countries have recently reported on increasing trends of water color in freshwaters, for which drivers are still not fully understood. We show here with more than 58000 water samples from the boreal and hemiboreal region of Sweden and Canada that absorbance of filtered water (a{$_{420}$}) co-varied with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (R{$^2$} = 0.85, P{$<$}0.0001), but that a{$_{420}$} relative to DOC is increased by the presence of iron (Fe). We found that concentrations of Fe significantly declined with increasing water retention in the landscape, resulting in significantly lower Fe concentrations in lakes compared to running waters. The Fe loss along the aquatic continuum corresponded to a proportional loss in a{$_{420}$}, suggesting a tight biogeochemical coupling between colored dissolved organic matter and Fe. Since water is being flushed at increasing rates due to enhanced runoff in the studied regions, diminished loss of Fe along the aquatic continuum may be one reason for observed trends in a{$_{420}$}, and in particular in a{$_{420}$}/DOC increases. If trends of increased Fe concentrations in freshwaters continue, water color will further increase with various effects on ecosystem services and biogeochemical cycles.},

A key to modeling this process is knowledge of apparent quantum yields (AQYs) for the photochemical products. Here we determined spectral AQYs for carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and carbon monoxide (CO), the main products of DOM photomineralization, along the main axis of the Delaware Estuary. Apparent quantum yields for CO(2) photoproduction were determined shipboard using a multi-spectral irradiation system. Carbon monoxide AQYs were determined in stored samples by employing a narrow band spectral irradiation system. A single AQY spectrum described carbon dioxide photochemical production within the estuary whereas CO AQY spectra varied with salinity, suggesting different precursors and mechanisms for the production of these two species. CO(2) AQYs were used along with shipboard measurements of DOM absorbance and solar irradiance to calculate photoproduction rates. Calculated CO(2) photoproduction rates agreed with directly measured rates (2 to 4 mu M CO(2) d(-1)) within experimental error, supporting the further development and use of AQYs to calculate regional-scale photochemical fluxes.

However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57\% of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2. The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. 3. We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. 4. An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

  abstract = {The fate of terrestrially-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important to carbon (C) cycling in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, and recent evidence suggests that climate warming is influencing DOC dynamics in northern ecosystems. To understand what determines the fate of terrestrial DOC, it is essential to quantify the chemical nature and potential biodegradability of this DOC. We examined DOC chemical characteristics and biodegradability collected from soil pore waters and dominant vegetation species in four boreal black spruce forest sites in Alaska spanning a range of hydrologic regimes and permafrost extents (Well Drained, Moderately Well Drained, Poorly Drained, and Thermokarst Wetlands). DOC chemistry was characterized using fractionation, UV-Vis absorbance, and fluorescence measurements. Potential biodegradability was assessed by incubating the samples and measuring CO2 production over I month. Soil pore water DOC from all sites was dominated by hydrophobic acids and was highly aromatic, whereas the chemical composition of vegetation leachate DOC varied significantly with species. There was no seasonal variability in soil pore water DOC chemical characteristics or biodegradability; however, DOC collected from the Poorly Drained site was significantly less biodegradable than DOC from the other three sites (6\% loss vs. 13-15\% loss). The biodegradability of vegetation-derived DOC ranged from 10 to 90\% loss, and was strongly correlated with hydrophilic DOC content. Vegetation such as Sphagnum moss and feathermosses yielded DOC that was quickly metabolized and respired. in contrast, the DOC leached from vegetation such as black spruce was moderately recalcitrant. Changes in DOC chemical characteristics that occurred during microbial metabolism of DOC were quantified using fractionation and fluorescence. The chemical characteristics and biodegradability of DOC in soil pore waters were most similar to the moderately recalcitrant vegetation leachates, and to the microbially altered DOC from all vegetation leachates.},

  abstract = {Landscape ecology deals with the effects of the spatial configuration of mosaics on a wide variety of ecological phenomena. Because problems in many areas of conservation biology and resource management are related to landscape use, development of a rigorous theoretical and empirical foundation for landscape ecology is essential. We present an approach to research that focuses on how individual-level mechanisms operating in a heterogeneous mosaic produce ecological patterns that are spatially dependent. The theoretical framework that we develop considers the density and distribution of a population among patches as a function of (a) within-patch movement patterns of individuals; (b) emigration from patches as a function of population density, patch configuration, patch context, and within-patch movement; and (c) loss of individuals as they disperse through landscape elements. This theoretical framework is coupled with an empirical approach that emphasizes the use of experimental model systems (EMS), small-scale systems occupying ''microlandscapes.'' Such systems are amenable to experimental manipulation with adequate replication and control and may serve as analogs of systems occurring at broader landscape scales. where rigorous empirical work is more difficult. We illustrate the use of EMS with examples from our studies of beetles and ants in North America and of voles in Norway. Finally, we consider some factors that may constrain extrapolations from EMS to other systems, scales, or levels. We believe that implementation of a mechanistic approach to landscape ecology is essential to deriving generalizations about how spatial heterogeneity influences ecological systems.},

It considers the ecological consequences of where things are located in space, where they are relative to other things, and how these relationships and their consequences are contingent on the characteristics of the surrounding landscape mosaic at multiple scales in time and space. Traditionally, landscape ecologists have focused their attention on terrestrial ecosystems, and rivers and streams have been considered either as elements of landscape mosaics or as units that are linked to the terrestrial landscape by flows across boundaries or ecotones. Less often, the heterogeneity that exists within a river or stream has been viewed as a 'riverscape' in its own right. 2. Landscape ecology can be unified about six central themes: (1) patches differ in quality (2) patch boundaries affect flows, (3) patch context matters, (4) connectivity is critical, (5) organisms are important, and (6) the importance of scale. Although riverine systems differ from terrestrial systems by virtue of the strong physical force of hydrology and the inherent connectivity provided by water flow, all of these themes apply equally to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and to the linkages between the two. 3. Landscape ecology therefore has important insights to offer to the study of riverine ecosystems, but these systems may also provide excellent opportunities for developing and testing landscape ecological theory. The principles and approaches of landscape ecology should be extended to include freshwater systems; it is time to take the 'land' out of landscape ecology.},

Absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM characteristics were related to environmental variables, microbial activity indicators (bacterial production and extracellular leucine aminopeptidase activity), and riparian land use to understand better how these factors influence DOM in streams. PARAFAC produced a six-component model (C1 to C6). Temperature correlated with each PARAFAC component, suggesting that water source, drainage area, and light penetration broadly affected DOM characteristics. C1 and C2 represented terrestrial, humic-like DOM fluorophore groups and comprised 41-65\% of stream DOM fluorescence. C5, a tryptophan-like component, related negatively to a humification index but positively to leucine-aminopeptidase activity and recently produced DOM, suggesting that C5 consisted of autochthonous, microbially produced DOM. C3, C4, and C6 showed signs of quinone-like, humic-like, and microbial transformable fluorophores. The distribution of these potentially redox-active PARAFAC components indicated that DOM was in a more reduced state in streams with higher bacterial production and agricultural land use than in streams with increased wetlands area, which had greater relative abundance of the oxidized quinone-like component. Anthropogenic land use and microbial activity altered the quantity and quality of DOM exported from human-affected streams from that observed in forest-and wetland-dominated streams. DOM in agriculturally affected streams was likely more labile and accessible to the microbial community than DOM in wetland streams, which supported low rates of microbial activity.},

Natural fluxes of UV-B radiation (280-320 nm) were manipulated with cutoff filters (Mylar(R)). There was substantial mortality in some of the zooplankton exposed to UV-B in the oligotrophic lake, but not in the eutrophic lake. Reproduction of Diaptomus was suppressed by UV-B down to 6 m in the oligotrophic lake. These data suggest that natural levels of UV-B radiation in the oligotrophic lake may prevent some species of zooplankton from continuously exploiting the warm surface waters during summer stratification. In the more eutrophic lake, UV-B is a less important constraint in the vertical distribution of zooplankton. These differences in the responses of zooplankton to natural UV-B radiation in lakes may alter their ecological interactions with food resources, predators and other environmental variables in the water column.},

Oligotrophic lakes have low nutrient loading and low productivity, while eutrophic lakes have high nutrients and high productivity. The strong empirical relationship between nutrient loading and productivity is a Valuable tool for teaching, for research, and for management of lakes. In order to incorporate the variety of other known anthropogenic impacts on lakes, however, lake characterization needs to extend beyond the nutrient-productivity paradigm. For example, acid precipitation, heavy metal and toxic organic contaminants, increases in UV radiation, and global warming are all recognized threats to lake ecosystems. One of the key characteristics of lakes that determines how they respond to disturbances such as these is their concentration of colored dissolved organic carbon (CDOC). Here we argue that a paradigm that includes CDOC (using the absorption coefficient at 320 nm as a proxy) as well as nutrients will be useful in predicting and understanding the response of lake ecosystems to multiple stressors. We propose to resurrect the CDOC axis that was proposed by investigators earlier this century and to extend it by adding some operational definitions to permit placing some of the major lake types on the axes in a way that will help us to better understand the structure, function, and response to disturbance of lake ecosystems that are subject to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes at the local, regional, and global scales. Data from a few diverse lakes and a successional sequence in Glacier Bay, Alaska, are used to illustrate the potential utility of the 2-axis model in separating lake types.},

Lakes and streams transport and alter nutrients, contaminants, and energy, and store signals of environmental change from local to continental scales over periods ranging from weeks to millennia.

Lakes and reservoirs comprise a geographically distributed network of the lowest points in the surrounding landscape that make them important sentinels of climate change. Their physical, chemical, and biological responses to climate provide a variety of information-rich signals. Their sediments archive and integrate these signals, enabling paleolimnologists to document changes over years to millennia. Lakes are also hot spots of carbon cycling in the landscape and as such are important regulators of climate change, processing terrestrial and atmospheric as well as aquatic carbon. We provide an overview of this concept of lakes and reservoirs as sentinels, integrators, and regulators of climate change, as well as of the need for scaling and modeling these responses in the context of global climate change. We conclude by providing a brief look to the future and the creation of globally networked sensors in lakes and reservoirs around the world.},

A detailed series of measurements and sampling were conducted over 6 tidal cycles within the frontal zone. An inverse relationship between the abundance of the 63 gm-net plankton and that of autotrophs indicated the impact of zooplankton grazing on autotrophic biomass, which was largely composed of diatoms. Within the 63 mum-net plankton, nauplii, copepodites and the adults of Eurytemora affinis appeared to be the most important grazers of autotrophs. First-order calculations illustrated that the primary production observed in the ETM is capable of supporting the biomass of this copepod and that its grazing pressure is capable of reducing autotrophic biomass in the brackish waters of the transition zone. Heterotrophic species were a small component ({$<$}20\%) of total microplankton in the freshwater samples, but dominated the total community biomass at higher salinities. This shift towards heterotrophic dominance implies a spatial coupling between upstream autotrophic production and downstream consumer processes. Analysis of stomach contents showed that the calanoid copepod E. affinis was the primary food source for larval fishes and mysids, although the combined ingestion rates of the 2 fish species are unlikely to have any impact on copepod standing stocks. By far the most important predators of the zooplankton are Neomysis americana and Mysis stenolepis. Estuarine circulation and associated entrapment processes ultimately control the trophic relationships and gradients in community structure within the ETM.},

Light exposed NOM had decreases in total organic carbon (TOC) of 8-35\% compared to samples kept in a refrigerator (dark, 4 degrees C), and the NOM became optically lighter, as shown by specific absorbance coefficients (SAC) taken at 340 nm (55-76\% decreases in SAC(340)).

  abstract = {Neutral landscape models, derived from percolation theory in the field of landscape ecology, are grid-based maps in which complex habitat distributions are generated by random or fractal algorithms. This grid-based representation of landscape structure is compatible with the raster-based format of geographical information systems (GIS), which facilitates comparisons between theoretical and real landscapes. Neutral landscape models permit the identification of critical thresholds in connectivity, which can be used to predict when landscapes will become fragmented. The coupling of neutral landscape models with generalized population models, such as metapopulation theory, provides a null model for generating predictions about population dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Neutral landscape models can contribute to the following applications in conservation: (1) incorporation of complex spatial patterns in (meta)population models; (2) identification of species' perceptions of landscape structure; (3) determination of landscape connectivity; (4) evaluation of the consequences of habitat fragmentation for population subdivision; (5) identification of the domain of metapopulation dynamics; (6) prediction of the occurrence of extinction thresholds; (7) determination of the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation; and (8) reserve design and ecosystem management. This generalized, spatially explicit framework bridges the gap between spatially implicit, patch-based models and spatially realistic GIS applications which are usually parameterized for a single species in a specific landscape. Development of a generalized, spatially explicit framework is essential in conservation biology because we will not be able to develop individual models for every species of management concern.},

Comparisons between satellite and in situ Rrs indicated good agreement for the shorter wavelengths, but weak relationships for both satellites for the 555 nm channel, and showed that radiometers deployed on multipurpose, off-the-shelf BGC-Argo floats can provide validation-quality measurements. About 300 chlorophyll a concentration match-ups were achieved within 18 months, which increased the number of validation data points available for the Indian Ocean as a whole by a factor of {\~ }4 from the previous historical record. Generally, the satellite data agreed with the float-derived chlorophyll concentration within the uncertainty of {$\pm$}35\%, for the band-difference (OCI) and band-ratio (OC3) algorithms, but not for a semianalytical ocean colour model (GSM) that exhibited significantly higher chlorophyll values ({$>$}100\% mean difference).

The DOC records were compared with others taken simultaneously for flow, pH, alkalinity, air temperature and rainfall, and in one of the catchments also for turbidity and conductivity. All records were examined by the seasonal Kendall test; frequency distributions of daily DOC measurements were examined; annual cycles were calculated, Autoregressive and impulse functions were derived for DOC against flow records. The time series analysis shows that: (i) DOC trends cannot be readily explained by trends in flow, pH, alkalinity, turbidity or conductivity; (ii) there is a significant increase in carbon flux from these catchments; (iii) maximum and minimum components of the annual distribution of daily readings both show increases in DOC, implying that DOC flux is increasing for differing hydrological pathways; (iv) increases in DOC concentrations coincide with increases in temperature, though the biggest increases in temperature are in the winter months when such increases might be expected to have less effect on DOC production; (v) change in trend, and therefore flux, was observed to occur after a severe drought in 1976. The study suggests that there are real, significant increases in carbon loss from upland peat catchments and that climate is a major driver, especially a severe drought. Severe drought triggering changes in the DOC flux might be attributed to enzymic latch mechanisms.},

  abstract = {A more general biogeographic theory of island species number is produced by replacing area with a more direct measure of available energy in the models of MacArthur and Wilson and Preston. This theory, species-energy theory, extends beyond species-area theory in that it applies to islands that differ in their per-unit-area productivity due to differences in physical environment, such as climate. Examination of data on species number of angiosperms and of land and freshwater birds on islands worldwide, ranging from Greenland and Spitsbergen to New Guinea and Jamaica, demonstrates that species-energy theory can explain 70 to 80\% of the variation in species number on such widely varying islands, and further suggests the existence of regular geographic trends in resource utilization or species-abundance patterns. The concepts embodied in species-energy theory can in principle be used to develop predictions of species' abundances and probabilities of occurrence on an island. Species-energy theory may also provide a unified basis for understanding a broad set of observations of patterns in species diversity.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: When ecologically important plant traits are correlated they may be said to constitute an ecological 'strategy' dimension. Through identifying these dimensions and understanding their inter-relationships we gain insight into why particular trait combinations are favoured over others and into the implications of trait differences among species. Here we investigated relationships among several traits, and thus the strategy dimensions they represented, across 2134 woody species from seven Neotropical forests. METHODS: Six traits were studied: specific leaf area (SLA), the average size of leaves, seed and fruit, typical maximum plant height, and wood density (WD). Trait relationships were quantified across species at each individual forest as well as across the dataset as a whole. 'Phylogenetic' analyses were used to test for correlations among evolutionary trait-divergences and to ascertain whether interspecific relationships were biased by strong taxonomic patterning in the traits. KEY RESULTS: The interspecific and phylogenetic analyses yielded congruent results. Seed and fruit size were expected, and confirmed, to be tightly related. As expected, plant height was correlated with each of seed and fruit size, albeit weakly. Weak support was found for an expected positive relationship between leaf and fruit size. The prediction that SLA and WD would be negatively correlated was not supported. Otherwise the traits were predicted to be largely unrelated, being representatives of putatively independent strategy dimensions. This was indeed the case, although WD was consistently, negatively related to leaf size. CONCLUSIONS: The dimensions represented by SLA, seed/fruit size and leaf size were essentially independent and thus conveyed largely independent information about plant strategies. To a lesser extent the same was true for plant height and WD. Our tentative explanation for negative WD-leaf size relationships, now also known from other habitats, is that the traits are indirectly linked via plant hydraulics.},

  abstract = {Photodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from stream waters was investigated using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis, ultraviolet-visible absorbance, three-dimensional excitational emission matrix fluorescence, and high-performance size exclusion chromatography. The effects of altering pH and various iron concentrations on DOM characteristics during irradiation were examined. DOC concentration, absorbance, and fluorescence all decreased with increasing irradiation. These decreases were accompanied by a decrease in absorbance spectral slope and average molecular size and a blue-shift in fluorescence maximum; decreasing pH enhanced these changes. The photooxidation rate constants were wavelength dependent. For the ratio of the photooxidation rate constant at pH 4 to that at pH 8 under ultraviolet irradiation, there were two maxima at wavelengths of approximately 280 and 320 nm, respectively, indicating that aromatic fractions were most pH photosensitive. The isolated humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) fractions had different photodegradation characteristics in terms of the photooxidation rate constant and the effects of pH and iron. The results suggest that iron played a more significant role in the photodegradation of the HA fraction than that of the FA fraction and that the HA fraction was mainly responsible for the observed DOM photodegradation. The results indicate that DOM photodegradation in stream waters is strongly influenced by iron and acidity.},

  abstract = {Absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy are economical tools for tracing the supply, turnover and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The colored and fluorescent fractions of DOM (CDOM and FDOM, respectively) are linked by the apparent fluorescence quantum yield (AQY) of DOM, which reflects the likelihood that chromophores emit fluorescence after absorbing light. Compared to the number of studies investigating CDOM and FDOM, few studies have systematically investigated AQY spectra for DOM, and linked them to fluorescence quantum yields (\cyrchar\CYRF ) of organic compounds. To offer a standardized approach, a MATLAB toolbox for the determination of apparent quantum yields of DOM (aquaDOM), featuring two calculation approaches, was developed and used to derive AQYs for samples from the Norwegian Sea. \cyrchar\CYRF{} of the organic compounds varied between 0.00079 and 0.35, whereas the average AQY for DOM samples at 350 nm was 0.011 {$\pm$} 0.003. The AQY at 350 nm increased with depth, while the AQY at 250 nm showed no trend. Laboratory tests indicated that \cyrchar\CYRF{} of compound mixtures are additive and represent an intermediate of the constituents. Additionally, the presence of non-fluorescent chromophores greatly suppressed calculated AQYs. Similar trends in the DOM AQY at 350 nm were observed in natural samples. We therefore hypothesize that fluorescence AQYs can indicate changes in the relative abundances of CDOM and FDOM. Additionally, the optical properties of 15 potential DOM constituents were determined and compared to more than 200 modelled spectra (PARAFAC components) in the OpenFluor database. Apparent matches, based on spectral similarity, were subsequently evaluated using molar fluorescence and absorbance. Five organic compounds were potential matches with PARAFAC components from 16 studies; however, the ability to confirm matches was limited due to multiple compounds exhibiting very similar spectra. This reiterates the fact that spectral similarity alone is insufficient evidence of the presence of particular compounds, and additional evidence is required.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 American Chemical Society. Molecular size plays an important role in dissolved organic matter (DOM) biogeochemistry, but its relationship with the fluorescent fraction of DOM (FDOM) remains poorly resolved. Here high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was coupled to fluorescence emission-excitation (EEM) spectroscopy in full spectral (60 emission and 34 excitation wavelengths) and chromatographic resolution ( {$<$} 1 Hz), to enable the mathematical decomposition of fluorescence on an individual sample basis by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The approach allowed cross-system comparisons of molecular size distributions for individual fluorescence components obtained from independent data sets. Spectra extracted from allochthonous DOM were highly similar. Allochthonous and autochthonous DOM shared some spectra, but included unique components. In agreement with the supramolecular assembly hypothesis, molecular size distributions of the fluorescence fractions were broad and chromatographically unresolved, possibly representing reoccurring fluorophores forming noncovalently bound assemblies of varying molecular size. Samples shared underlying fluorescence components that differed in their size distributions but not their spectral properties. Thus, in contrast to absorption measurements, bulk fluorescence is unlikely to reliably indicate the average molecular size of DOM. The one-sample approach enables robust and independent cross-site comparisons without large-scale sampling efforts and introduces new analytical opportunities for elucidating the origins and biogeochemical properties of FDOM.},

The molecular size of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) was consistently higher than that of fluorescent DOM (FDOM), with an average difference of 0.37 kDa. The relative abundance of FDOM vs. CDOM ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 across lakes, and increased with decreasing average molecular size. Across sites, the CDOM spectral slopes of the large molecular size fraction were highly similar while the low molecular size fraction differed and contributed to different bulk spectral slopes. Our results indicate structural congruence of high molecular size DOM across systems while lake trophic status determined the characteristics of the low size range. Furthermore, the combination of HPSEC and parallel factor analysis (HPSEC-PARAFAC2) allowed the decomposition of DOM fluorescence chromatograms. Three humic-like components and one protein-like component with broadly overlapping molecular size distributions were identified. This overlap provides further evidence for the supramolecular assembly hypothesis since fluorophores, as revealed by PARAFAC2, occur in aggregates of overlapping molecular size. Our results further suggest a link between the molecular size of these fluorophores and the associated supramolecular assemblies. This study demonstrates the potential for HPSEC and novel mathematical approaches to provide unprecedented insights into the relationship between optical and chemical properties of DOM in aquatic systems.},

The data set consists of {$>$}10,000 glider profiles and repeated vessel-based hydrog- raphy and velocity transects. It allows a detailed description of the eddy formation and its impact on the near-coastal salinity, oxygen, and nutrient distributions. In early January, a strong PCUC with maximum pole- ward velocities of ?0.25 m/s at 100\textendash 200m depth was observed. Starting on 20 January, a subsurface anticy- clonic eddy developed in the PCUC downstream of a topographic bend, suggesting flow separation as the eddy formation mechanism. The eddy core waters exhibited oxygen concentration of {$<$}1 lmol/kg, an ele- vated nitrogen deficit of ?17 lmol/L, and potential vorticity close to zero, which seemed to originate from the bottom boundary layer of the continental slope. The eddy-induced across-shelf velocities resulted in an elevated exchange of water masses between the upper continental slope and the open ocean. Small-scale salinity and oxygen structures were formed by along-isopycnal stirring, and indications of eddy-driven oxy- gen ventilation of the upper oxygen minimum zone were observed. It is concluded that mesoscale stirring of solutes and the offshore transport of eddy core properties could provide an important coastal open ocean exchange mechanism with potentially large implications for nutrient budgets and biogeochemical cycling in the oxygen minimum zone off Peru.},

The EEM overall fluorescence intensity per unit total organic carbon (FI/TOC) and the overall FI per unit UV absorbance (FI/UVA), which represent the gross fluorescence efficiency and apparent quantum yield, respectively, were found to increase significantly as the MWCO decreased from 0.7 {$\mu$}m to 1 kDa. Further elaboration of the excitation (Ex) and emission (Em) spectra revealed that the smaller- and larger-MW fractions tend to occur in the lower-wavelength (Ex {$<$} 300 nm, Em {$<$} 280 nm) and higher-wavelength (Em {$>$} 400 nm) regions, respectively. The EEM spectra in these particular regions produced highly significant relationships between the relative intensity and log-MWCO (from 0.7 {$\mu$}m to 1 kDa) with R2 {$>$} 0.83 at specific Ex/Em positions. The optimal Ex/Em positions for the relationships differed according to the source of the DOM that varies with process types (e.g. membrane bioreactor vs. oxidation ditch) and process stages (e.g. sludge mixed liquor vs. membrane effluent). The results of this study provide new insights with regard to the possible use of fluorescence spectroscopy for qualitative or quasi-quantitative indication of DOM MW in wastewater treatment systems.},

Diurnal cycles of surface water CO concentration ([CO]) occurred in autumn but not in spring. In both seasons [CO] was well above air-equilibrium at most stations (maximum of 12,500\% saturation) and dropped with depth to undetectable levels below 50 m. Mean surface water [CO] and CO water-column burdens (0-50 m) were 0.45 nmol L-1 and 5.0 {$\mu$}mol m-2 in autumn and 4.7 nmol L-1 and 64.8 {$\mu$}mol m-2 in spring, and the sea-to-air CO flux was 33 times higher in spring. The efficiency of CO photoproduction correlated linearly with CDOM across the Mackenzie River estuary, the Mackenzie Shelf, and the Amundsen Gulf. Modeled water-column CO photoproduction in spring was 15 times that in autumn (45.8 vs. 3.0 {$\mu$}mol m-2 d-1). Microbial CO uptake followed first-order kinetics in autumn while Hill-type, saturation, and inhibition kinetics were common in surface waters in spring. Bio-oxidation was the dominant CO loss term in autumn while gas exchange was almost equally important in spring. Higher photoproduction and slower bio-uptake in spring resulted in the wide autumn-spring differences in the [CO] distribution pattern and air-sea CO flux. CO cycling in cold northern waters differs both quantitatively and qualitatively from that in warmer seas. \textcopyright{} 2009, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.}

  abstract = {Abstract. Photochemistry of dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in marine biogeochemical cycles, including the regeneration of inorganic nutrients. DOM photochemistry affects nitrogen cycling by converting bio-refractory dissolved organic nitrogen to labile inorganic nitrogen, mainly ammonium (NH4+). During the August 2009 Mackenzie Light and Carbon (MALINA) Program, the absorbed photon-based efficiency spectra of NH4+ photoproduction (i.e. photoammonification) were determined using water samples from the SE Beaufort Sea, including the Mackenzie River estuary, shelf, and Canada Basin. The photoammonification efficiency decreased with increasing wavelength across the ultraviolet and visible regimes and was higher in offshore waters than in shelf and estuarine waters. The efficiency was positively correlated with the molar nitrogen:carbon ratio of DOM and negatively correlated with the absorption coefficient of chromophoric DOM (CDOM). Combined with collateral measurements of CO2 and CO photoproduction, this study revealed a stoichiometry of DOM photochemistry with a CO2 : CO : NH4+ molar ratio of 165 : 11 : 1 in the estuary, 60 : 3 : 1 on the shelf, and 18 : 2 : 1 in the Canada Basin. The NH4+ efficiency spectra, along with solar photon fluxes, CDOM absorption coefficients and sea ice concentrations, were used to model the monthly surface and depth-integrated photoammonification rates in 2009. The summertime (June\textendash August) rates at the surface reached 6.6 nmol l-1 d-1 on the Mackenzie Shelf and 3.7 nmol l-1 d-1 further offshore; the depth-integrated rates were correspondingly 8.8 {$\mu$}mol m-2 d-1 and 11.3 {$\mu$}mol m-2 d-1. The offshore depth-integrated rate in August (8.0 {$\mu$}mol m-2 d-1) was comparable to the missing dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) source required to support the observed primary production in the upper 10-m layer of that area. The yearly NH4+ photoproduction in the entire study area was estimated to be 1.4 \texttimes{} 108 moles, with 85\% of it being generated in summer when riverine DIN input is low. Photoammonification could mineralize 4\% of the annual dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) exported from the Mackenzie River and provide a DIN source corresponding to 7\% of the riverine DIN discharge and 1400 times the riverine NH4+ flux. Under a climate warming-induced ice-free scenario, these quantities could increase correspondingly to 6\%, 11\%, and 2100 times. Photoammonification is thus a significant nitrogen cycling term and may fuel previously unrecognized autotrophic and heterotrophic production pathways in the surface SE Beaufort Sea.},

For accurate retrieval of Chl a concentrations acquired by in vivo fluorometer, a two-step procedure is applied: 1) A predeployment intercalibration with accurate determination by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, which not only calibrates fluorescence in appropriate Chl a concentration units, but also strongly reduces variability between fluorometers, and 2) a profile-by-profile quenching correction analysis, which effectively eliminates the fluorescence quenching issue at surface around noon, and results in consistent profiles between day and night. The quenching correction is conducted through an extrapolation of the deep fluorescence value toward surface. As proved by a validation procedure in the Western Mediterranean Sea, the correction method is practical and relatively reliable when there is no credible reference, especially for deep mixed waters, as in the Southern Ocean. Even in the shallow mixed waters, the method is also effective in reducing the influence of quenching.},

We report here the pH- and cation-dependent size variations of COMs with different sources (river and lake) quantified using flow field-flow fractionation (FIFFF), fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR\textendash FTIR) spectroscopy, and zeta potential analysis. Increasing pH caused a decline in molecular sizes and an obvious size transformation from the {$>$}10 kDa to 5\textendash 10 kDa and further to 1\textendash 5 kDa size fraction, whereas the opposite trend was observed for increasing cation (e.g., Ca2+ and Cu2+) abundance. Compared with lakewater COM, the riverwater COM exhibited a greater pH-dependent dispersion but less extent in cation-induced aggregation, demonstrating that the dispersion and aggregation dynamics were highly dependent on COM source and solution chemistry (e.g., pH and cations). Based on ATR\textendash FTIR analysis, the extensive dissolution of C=O and C\textendash O functional groups resulted in a greater pH-dependent dispersion for river COM. Fluorescence titration revealed that, despite their similar cation-induced aggregation behavior, the binding constants of all the PARAFAC-derived components for Cu2+ were 1\textendash 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for Ca2+ (logKM: 4.54\textendash 5.45 vs. 3.35\textendash 3.70), indicating a heterogeneous nature in cation-DOM interactions. The greater extent of decline in zeta potential for lake COM suggested a Ca-induced charge neutralization and aggregation mechanism. However, for Cu-induced aggregation, chemical complexation was the predominant pathway for the river COM, with higher binding constants, while charge neutralization and chemical complexation co-induced the aggregation of lake COM. Thus, natural COMs may have different environmental behavior along the aquatic continuum and further affect the fate and transport of contaminants in aquatic environments.},

However, temporal and spatial variability of DOM composition and thus its quality in such rivers, on landscape and basin scales, have not been well documented. In this study, we present data on the spatial distribution of DOM quantity and quality based on source, molecular weight, and composition using optical properties including excitation emission matrix fluorescence with parallel factor analysis. We compared such DOM quantity and quality determinations in main river channels and their tributaries for three river systems of the Guayana Shield, Venezuela. Spatial variabilities of DOM parameters were strongly related to differences in the geological settings of the drainage basins and presumably their associated vegetation cover. Linear relationships between quantitative and qualitative DOM parameters were also evident, suggesting that high DOC concentration correlated with chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) characteristics of higher molecular weight associated with terrestrial sources, while low DOC concentrations correlated with CDOM characteristics of lower molecular weight associated primarily with microbial sources. Such relationships seem to imply that DOM concentrations and their sources/characteristics may be coupled in the studied fluvial systems. In addition, shifts in DOM compositions between terrestrial and microbial signals were observed with changes in water discharge and in watersheds disturbed by gold mining activities. The observed linkages between, and the changes among DOM quantity and quality, suggest that the biogeochemistry of DOM in tropical rivers may be quite sensitive to climatic and land use change.},

Anthropogenic pressures combined with climate disturbances such as hurricanes can affect the biogeochemistry of the region and threaten the health of this unique ecosystem. As such, water quality monitoring has historically been implemented in the Florida Keys, and six spatially distinct zones have been identified. In these studies however, dissolved organic matter (DOM) has only been studied as a quantitative parameter, and DOM composition can be a valuable biogeochemical parameter in assessing environmental change in coastal regions. Here we report the first data of its kind on the application of optical properties of DOM, in particular excitation emission matrix fluorescence with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC), throughout these six Florida Keys regions in an attempt to assess spatial differences in DOM sources. Our data suggests that while DOM in the Florida Keys can be influenced by distant terrestrial environments such as the Everglades, spatial differences in DOM distribution were also controlled in part by local surface runoff/fringe mangroves, contributions from seasgrass communities, as well as the reefs and waters from the Florida Current. Application of principal component analysis (PCA) of the relative abundance of EEM-PARAFAC components allowed for a clear distinction between the sources of DOM (allochthonous vs. autochthonous), between different autochthonous sources and/or the diagenetic status of DOM, and further clarified contribution of terrestrial DOM in zones where levels of DOM were low in abundance. The combination between EEM-PARAFAC and PCA proved to be ideally suited to discern DOM composition and source differences in coastal zones with complex hydrology and multiple DOM sources. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Standard DOM, namely humic acid, fulvic acid and hydrophilic acid, from the Suwannee River were tested to ascertain the performance and sensitivity of the method. In addition to four compounds groups: humic substances (Peak 1, AMW 16kD), fulvic acids (Peak 2, AMW 11kD), low AMW acids (Peak 3, AMW 5kD), and low AMW neutral and amphiphilic molecules, proteins and their amino acid building blocks (Peak 4, AMW 3kD), an new group that appears to include low AMW, 6-10kD, humic substances was found based on investigating the spectra at various elution times. The spectroscopic parameter S {$>$}365 (slope at wavelengths {$>$}365nm) was determined to be a good predictor of the AMW of the DOM. The detector wavelength played an important role in evaluating the AMW distribution. For some fractions, such as the humic and low AMW non-aromatic substances, the error in measurement was ??30\% as determined by two-dimensional chromatograms detected at an artificially selected wavelength. HPLC-SEC with multiple wavelength absorbance detection was found to be a useful technique for DOM characterization. It characterized the AMW distributions of DOM more accurately and provided additional, potentially important information concerning the properties of DOM with varying AMWs. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The absorption coefficient (a350) in the freshwater end-member ranged from 0.15 to 12.5m-1 among estuaries. The a350 and fluorescence intensities correlated positively with population density and the chlorophyll a concentration, likely due to the additions of CDOM from anthropogenic activities and autochthonous production. The freshwater a350 also correlated negatively with precipitation, headwater altitude and freshwater discharge. The a350 generally decreased linearly with increasing salinity in most estuaries. Humic-like fluorescent components had intensities strongly correlated with a350, while protein-like components received notable additions in five estuaries but were removed in another five estuaries. The absorption spectral slope (S275-295) and slope ratio (SR; 275-295nm slope: 350-400nm slope) generally increased with increasing salinity, likely reflecting a decrease in the average molecular weight. The contribution of protein-like components to the total fluorescence changed greatly among different estuaries, which was in part associated with river population density and precipitation. The results showed that both the catchment characteristics and estuarine biogeochemical processes contributed to the variations of CDOM level and composition in estuarine environments. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The 18S rRNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) gene phylogeny place these strains within the family Mamiellaceae (Mamiellales, Mamiellophyceae) in two separate clades of the genus Mantoniella. ITS2 synapomorphies support their placement as two new species, Mantoniella beaufortii and Mantoniella baffinensis. Both species have round green cells with diameter between 3\textendash 5 \textmu m, one long flagellum and a short reduced flagellum (\{\textbackslash{\~ }\{\}\}1 \textmu m) and are covered by spiderweb-like scales, making both species similar to other Mantoniella species. Morphologically, M. beaufortii and M. baffinensis are most similar to the cosmopolitan M. squamata with only minor differences in scale structure distinguishing them. Screening of global marine metabarcoding datasets indicates M. beaufortii has only been recorded in seawater and sea ice samples from the Arctic while no environmental barcode matches M. baffinensis. Like other Mamiellophyceae genera that have distinct polar and temperate species, the polar distribution of these new species suggests they are cold or ice-adapted Mantoniella species.},

In this context, we tested the importance of habitat variables at two spatial scales (patch and landscape) in driving fish community assembly using experimental artificial reefs constructed across a gradient of seagrass cover in a coastal bay of The Bahamas. We found that species richness and benthic fish abundance increased over time, but eventually reached an asymptote. The correlation between habitat variables and community structure strengthened over time, suggesting deterministic processes were detectable in community assembly. Abundance of benthic fishes, as well as overall community structure, were predicted by both patch- and landscape-scale variables, with the cover of seagrass at the landscape-scale emerging as the most important explanatory variable. Results of this study indicate that landscape features can drive differences in community assembly even within a general habitat type (i.e., within seagrass beds). A primary implication of this finding is that human activities driving changes in seagrass cover may cause significant shifts in faunal community structure well before complete losses of seagrass habitat.},

Here, we examined the effects of a cladoceran (Daphnia) and a calanoid copepod (Eodiaptomus) on algal and microbial plankton in a Japanese lake using in situ experiments in which we manipulated the nutrient supply and biomass of these macrozooplankton. The response of algal and microbial plankton to macrozooplankton was diverse and varied depending on the level of nutrient supply. Eodiaptomus seemed to feed mainly on large algae ({$>$} 20 mum) and microzooplankton, while direct grazing by Daphnia on algae, bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), and microzooplankton (ciliates, heliozoa, and rotifers) was pronounced. Trophic linkages within these microbial plankton was also suggested; bacteria were grazed by HNF and these in turn were grazed by microzooplankton. When the nutrient supply was high, both HNF and microzooplankton were exposed to higher amounts of algae and lower bacterial abundance. Moreover, nutrient regeneration by daphnids and Eodiaptomus copepods seemed to differentially stimulate the growth of algae and bacteria. The results suggest that the relationship between macrozooplankton and microbial plankton cannot be fully understood without taking into consideration not only the feeding characteristics of the macrozooplankton, but also the food web structure. the subsidized algal resource, and nutrient regeneration from the macrozooplankton.},

  abstract = {Colored dissolved organic material (CDOM) is an important sunlight absorbing substance affecting the optical properties of natural waters. However, little is known about its structural and optical properties mainly due to its complex matrix and the limitation of the techniques available. A comparison of two southwestern Florida rivers [the Caloosahatchee River (CR) and the Shark River (SR)] was done in terms of molecular mass (MM) and diffusion coefficients (D). The novel technique Frit inlet/frit outlet-flow field-flow fractionation (FIFO-FIFFF) with absorbance and fluorescence detectors was used to determine these properties. The SR receives organic material from the Everglades. By contrast, the CR arises from Lake Okeechobee in central Florida, receiving anthropogenic inputs, farming runoff, and natural organics. Both rivers discharge to the Gulf of Mexico. Fluorescence identified, for both rivers, two different MM distributions in low salinity water samples: the first was centered at approximately 1.7 kDa (CR) and approximately 2 kDa (SR); the second centered at approximately 13 kDa for both rivers, which disappeared gradually in the river plumes to below detection limit in coastal waters. Absorbance detected only one MM distribution centered at approximately 2 kDa (CR) and 2.2-2.4 kDa (SR). Fluorescence in general peaked at a lower MM than absorbance, suggesting a different size distribution for fluorophores vs chromophores. A photochemical study showed that, after sunlight, irradiated freshwater samples have similar characteristics to more marine waters, including a shift in MM distribution of chromophores. The differences observed between the rivers in the optical characteristics, MM distributions, and D values suggest that the CDOM sources, physical, and photochemical degradation processes are different for these two rivers.},

The revised model also correctly reproduces the zonal distributions of vegetation types. In reproducing the dependence of the vegetation distribution on climate conditions, the model shows that the dominant regions for trees, grasses, shrubs, and bare soil are clearly separated by a climate index derived from mean annual precipitation and temperature, in good agreement with the CLM4 surface data.

This new study was undertaken to reduce the most noticeable systematic errors in our previous results ( flux data set calculated mainly using International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project-Cl input data (ISCCP-FC)) by exploiting the availability of a more advanced NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) radiative transfer model and improved ISCCP cloud climatology and ancillary data sets. The most important changes are the introduction of a better treatment of ice clouds, revision of the aerosol climatology, accounting for diurnal variations of surface skin/air temperatures and the cloud-radiative effects on them, revision of the water vapor profiles used, and refinement of the land surface albedos and emissivities. We also extend our previous flux results, limited to the top of atmosphere (TOA) and surface (SRF), to also include three levels within the atmosphere, forming one integrated vertical atmospheric flux profile from SRF to TOA, inclusive, by combining a new climatology of cloud vertical structure with the ISCCP cloud product. Using the new radiative transfer model and new input data sets, we have produced an 18-year at 3-hour time steps, global at 280-km intervals, radiative flux profile data set (called ISCCP-FD) that provides full- and clear-sky, shortwave and longwave, upwelling and downwelling fluxes at five levels ( SRF, 680 mbar, 440 mbar, 100 mbar, and TOA). Evaluation is still only possible for TOA and SRF fluxes: Comparisons of monthly, regional mean values from FD with Earth Radiation Budget Experiment, Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System and Baseline Surface Radiation Network values suggest that we have been able to reduce the overall uncertainties from 10-15 to 5-10 W/m(2) at TOA and from 20-25 to 10 15 W/m(2) at SRF. Annual mean pressure-latitude cross sections of the cloud effects on atmospheric net radiative fluxes show that clouds shift the longwave cooling downward in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, acting to stabilize the tropical atmosphere while increasing the horizontal heating gradient forcing the Hadley circulation, and shift the longwave cooling upward in the midlatitude storm zones, acting to destabilize the baroclinic zones while decreasing the horizontal heating gradient there.},

  abstract = {The optical properties and spatial distribution of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu were evaluated and compared to the results in literature. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from 8.75 to 20.19 mg L super(-1) with an average of (13.10 +/-3.51) mg L super(-1). CDOM absorption coefficients a( lambda ) at 280 nm, 355 nm, and 440 nm were in the range 11.28..33.46 m super(-1) (average (20.95 +/-5.52) m super(-1)), 2.42..7.90 m super(-1) (average (4.92 +/-1.29) m super(-1)), and 0.65..2.44 m super(-1) (average (1.46 +/-0.44) m super(-1)), respectively. In general, CDOM absorption coefficient and DOC concentration were found to decrease away from the river inflow to Meiliang Bay towards the lake center. The values of the DOC-specific absorption coefficients a*( lambda ), given as absorption coefficient related to mass concentration of organic carbon [copyright] ranged from 0.28 to 0.47 L mg super(-1) m super(-1) at 355 nm. The determination coefficients between CDOM absorption and DOC concentration decreased with the increase of wavelength from 280 to 550 nm. The linear regression relationship between CDOM absorption at 280 nm and DOC concentration was following: a(280 nm) = 1.507 L mg super(-1) m super(-1) . DOC + 1.215 m super(-1). The spectral slope S values were dependent on the wavelength range used in the regression. The estimated S values decreased with increasing wavelength range used. A significant negative linear relationship was found between CDOM absorption coefficients, DOC-specific absorption coefficients and estimated S values especially in longer wavelength range. The linear regression relationship between DOC-specific absorption coefficients at 440 nm and estimated S values during the wavelength range from 280 to 500 nm was following: a*(440 nm) = (-0.021 mu m .

Fuer den geloesten organisch gebundenen Kohlenstoff (DOC) wurden Konzentrationen zwischen 8.75 mg L super(-1) und 20.19 mg L super(-1) gefunden, mit einem Mittelwert von (13.10 +/- 3.51) mg L super(-1). Die Absorptionskoeffizienten der CDOM bei 280 nm, 355 nm und 440 nm bewegten sich im Bereich von 11.28..33.46 m super(-1) (Mittelwert: (20.95 +/- 5.52) m super(-1)), 2.42..7.90 m super(-1) (Mittelwert: (4.92 +/- 1.29) m super(-1)) bzw. 0.65..2.44 m super(-1) (Mittelwert: (1.46 +/- 0.44) m super(-1)). Generell wurde eine Abnahme des Absorptionskoeffizienten der CDOM und der DOC-Konzentration vom Zufluss in die Meiliang-Bucht hin zur Mitte des Sees beobachtet. Die Werte fuer den auf die DOC-Konzentration bezogenen Absorptionskoeffizienten bei 355 nm lagen im Bereich von 0.28 bis 0.47 L mg super(- 1) m super(-1). Die Korrelation zwischen Absorptionsvermoegen der CDOM und DOC- Konzentration nahm von 280 bis 550 nm mit steigender Wellenlaenge ab.

  abstract = {The increase of ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400nm) caused by stratospheric ozone depletion has profound effects on aquatic ecosystems. High-altitude lakes in the Yunnan Plateau are exposed to high intensities of UVR and contain low concentrations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Thirty-eight lakes in the Yunnan Plateau with elevations from 1291 to 3809m above sea level were investigated to study CDOM concentrations and possible effects of UVR on the lake ecosystem. The attenuation of UVR in the Yunnan Plateau lakes was calculated from the absorption coefficient of CDOM based on an empirical relationship from lakes in the Alps and Pyrenees mountains. Absorption coefficients [a(lambda)] at 320nm [a(320)] ranged from 0.52 to 14.05 m(-1) (mean standard deviation, 4.40 3.85 m(-1)) and at 380 nm [a(380)] from 0.05 to 4.51 m(-1) (1.40 1.30m(-1)). The exponential slope coefficient for the relationship of wavelength to a(lambda) ranged from 16.2 to 41.4 mu m(-1) (21.74 +/- 4.93 mu m(-1)) over the 280-400nm interval. Normalized fluorescence emission (NFLU) at 450nm from an excitation wavelength of 355 nm, F-n(355), averaged 7.93 +/- 3.22 NFLU. A significant positive relationship was found between a(355) and F,(355). The estimated diffuse attenuation coefficients of UV-B (320nm) and UV-A (380nm) ranged from 0.55 to 15.77 m(-1) and from 0.24 to 6.73 m(-1); the corresponding 1\% attenuation depths ranged from 0.29 to 8.44 m and from 0.68 to 19.42 m. Twenty-five of 38 lakes had 1\% UV-13 attenuation depths of 1.5 m or more. The median 1\% attenuation depth was 28.8\% of the sampling depth for UV-B radiation and 60\% for UV-A.

  abstract = {Absorptions by non-phytoplankton particles and phytoplankton, and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were measured at 50 sites in large, shallow, Lake Taihu in winter and summer 2006 to study their seasonal and spatial variations, and their relative contributions to total absorption. The CDOM absorption was significantly higher in winter than in summer, due to degradation and release of fixed carbon in phytoplankton and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). The hyperbolic model was used to model the spectral absorption of CDOM, and the mean spectral slope of 6.38 nm(-1) was obtained. At most sites, the spectral absorption of non-phytoplankton particles was similar to that of the total particles, demonstrating that the absorption of the total particles is dominated by the absorption of non-phytoplankton particles. In summer, phytoplankton absorption increased markedly, due to frequent algal blooms especially in Meiliang Bay. In winter, the significant increase in non-phytoplankton particle absorption resulted from the increase of inorganic particulate matter caused by sediment resuspension. Strong linear relationships were found between ad(440) and total suspended matter (TSM), organic suspended matter (OSM), and inorganic suspended matter (ISM). Strong linear relationships were also found between a(ph)(440), a(ph)(675) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration. The total relative contributions of non-phytoplankton particles over the range of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (400-700 nm) were 48.4 and 79.9\% in summer and winter respectively. Non-phytoplankton particle absorption dominated the total absorption, especially in winter, in Lake Taihu, due to frequent sediment resuspension in the large shallow lake as a result of strong windy conditions. The results indicate that strong absorption by CDOM and non-phytoplankton particles at the blue wavelength has an impact on the spectral availability, and acts as a selection factor for the composition of the phytoplankton community, with cyanobacteria being the dominate species in Lake Taihu.},

  abstract = {Absorption measurements from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and their relationships with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and fluorescence were studied in Lake Taihu, a large, shallow, subtropical lake in China. Absorption spectra of lake water samples were measured from 240 nm to 800 nm. Highest values of a(lambda), DOC and F-n (355) occurred near the river inflow to Meiliang Bay and decreased towards the central lake basin. A significant spatial difference was found between Meiliang Bay and the central lake basin in absorption coefficient, DOC-specific absorption coefficient, exponential slope coefficient, DOC concentration and fluorescence value. The spatial distribution of CDOM suggested that a major part of CDOM in the lake was from river input. CDOM absorption coefficients were correlated with DOC over the wavelength range 280-500 nm, and a(355) was also correlated with F-n (355), which showed that CDOM absorption could be inferred from DOC and fluorescence measurement. The coefficient of variation between a(lambda) and DOC concentration decreased with increase in wavelength from 240 nm to 800 nm. Furthermore, a significant negative linear relationship was recorded between S value and CDOM absorption coefficient, as well as DOC-specific absorption coefficient. S value and DOC-specific absorption coefficient were used as a proxy for CDOM composition and source. Accurate CDOM absorption measurements are very useful in explaining UV attenuation and in developing, validating remote sensing model of water quality in Lake Taihu.},

It is important to know if there are hotspots and if the hotspots are statistically significant. In this study identification of pollution hotspots was investigated using Pb concentrations in urban soils of Galway City in Ireland as an example, and the influencing factors on results of hotspot identification were investigated. The index of local Moran's I is a useful tool for identifying pollution hotspots of Pb pollution in urban soils, and for classifying them into spatial clusters and spatial outliers. The results were affected by the definition of weight function, data transformation and existence of extreme values. Compared with the results for the positively skewed raw data, the transformed data and data with extreme values excluded revealed a larger area for the high value spatial clusters in the city centre. While it is hard to decide the best way of using this index, it is suggested that all these influencing factors should be considered until reasonable and reliable results are obtained. GIS mapping can be applied to help evaluate the results via visualization of the spatial patterns. Meanwhile, selected pollution hotspots (extreme values) in this study were confirmed by re-analyses and re-sampling.},

CDOM absorption, fluorescence, and the spectral slope indicating the CDOM composition were studied using 0.22-mu m-filtered samples of Meiliang Bay water from Lake Taihu that were exposed to short-term (0-12 h) simulated UV-B radiation and long-term (0-12 days) natural solar radiation in summer. CDOM absorption coefficient and fluorescence decreased with increasing exposure time, which relates to the amounts of absorbed light energy. The decreases of CDOM absorption and normalized fluorescence corresponded to first order kinetics reactions. Different decreases of CDOM absorption and fluorescence at different wavelengths suggested that the composition of CDOM changed when it absorbed ultraviolet radiation. Photochemical degradation increased the spectral slope during 275-295 nm region (S275-295) but decreased the spectral slope during 275-295 nm region (S350-400). The slope ratio S-R (S275-295: S350-400) increased in the photochemical process, which could be used as an indicator of photobleaching and composition change of CDOM. Our results show that photochemical degradation is important in the cycling of CDOM, which indicated change in the composition of CDOM.},

  abstract = {CDOM biogeochemical cycle is driven by several physical and biological processes such as river input, biogeneration and photobleaching that act as primary sinks and sources of CDOM. Watershed-derived allochthonous (WDA) and phytoplankton-derived autochthonous (PDA) CDOM were exposed to 9 days of natural solar radiation to assess the photobleaching response of different CDOM sources, using absorption and fluorescence (excitation-emission matrix) spectroscopy. Our results showed a marked decrease in total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentration under natural sunlight exposure for both WDA and PDA CDOM, indicating photoproduction of ammonium from TDN. In contrast, photobleaching caused a marked increase in total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentration for both WDA and PDA CDOM. Thus TDN{$:$}TDP ratios decreased significantly both for WDA and PDA CDOM, which partially explained the seasonal dynamic of TDN{$:$}TDP ratio in Lake Taihu. Photobleaching rate of CDOM absorption a(254), was 0.032 m/MJ for WDA CDOM and 0.051 m/MJ for PDA CDOM from days 0-9, indicating that phototransformations were initially more rapid for the newly produced CDOM from phytoplankton than for the river CDOM. Extrapolation of these values to the field indicated that 3.9\%-5.1\% CDOM at the water surface was photobleached and mineralized every day in summer in Lake Taihu. Photobleaching caused the increase of spectral slope, spectral slope ratio and molecular size, indicating the CDOM mean molecular weight decrease which was favorable to further microbial degradation of mineralization. Three fluorescent components were validated in parallel factor analysis models calculated separately for WDA and PDA CDOM. Our study suggests that the humic-like fluorescence materials could be rapidly and easily photobleached for WDA and PDA CDOM, but the protein-like fluorescence materials was not photobleached and even increased from the transformation of the humic-like fluorescence substance to the protein-like fluorescence substance. Photobleaching was an important driver of CDOM and nutrients biogeochemistry in lake water.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Rates and apparent quantum yields of photomineralization (AQYDOC) and photomethanification (AQYCH4) of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Saguenay River surface water were determined at three widely differing dissolved oxygen concentrations ([O2]) (suboxic, air saturation, and oxygenated) using simulated-solar radiation. Photomineralization increased linearly with CDOM absorbance photobleaching for all three O2 treatments. Whereas the rate of photochemical dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loss increased with increasing [O2], the ratio of fractional DOC loss to fractional absorbance loss showed an inverse trend. CDOM photodegradation led to a higher degree of mineralization under suboxic conditions than under oxic conditions. AQYDOC determined under oxygenated, suboxic, and air-saturated conditions increased, decreased, and remained largely constant with photobleaching, respectively; AQYDOC obtained under air saturation with short-term irradiations could thus be applied to longer exposures. AQYDOC decreased successively from ultraviolet B (UVB) to ultraviolet A (UVA) to visible (VIS), which, alongside the solar irradiance spectrum, points to VIS and UVA being the primary drivers for photomineralization in the water column. The photomineralization rate in the Saguenay River was estimated to be 2.31 \texttimes{} 108 mol C yr-1, accounting for only 1 \% of the annual DOC input into this system. Photoproduction of CH4 occurred under both suboxic and oxic conditions and increased with decreasing [O2], with the rate under suboxic conditions {$\sim$} 7\textendash 8 times that under oxic conditions. Photoproduction of CH4 under oxic conditions increased linearly with photomineralization and photobleaching. Under air saturation, 0.00057 \% of the photochemical DOC loss was diverted to CH4, giving a photochemical CH4 production rate of 4.36 \texttimes{} 10-6 mol m-2 yr-1 in the Saguenay River and, by extrapolation, of (1.9\textendash 8.1) \texttimes{} 108 mol yr-1 in the global ocean. AQYCH4 changed little with photobleaching under air saturation but increased exponentially under suboxic conditions. Spectrally, AQYCH4 decreased sequentially from UVB to UVA to VIS, with UVB being more efficient under suboxic conditions than under oxic conditions. On a depth-integrated basis, VIS prevailed over UVB in controlling CH4 photoproduction under air saturation while the opposite held true under O2-deficiency. An addition of micromolar levels of dissolved dimethyl sulfide (DMS) substantially increased CH4 photoproduction, particularly under O2-deficiency; DMS at nanomolar ambient concentrations in surface oceans is, however, unlikely a significant CH4 precursor. Results from this study suggest that CDOM-based CH4 photoproduction only marginally contributes to the CH4 supersaturation in modern surface oceans and to both the modern and Archean atmospheric CH4 budgets, but that the photochemical term can be comparable to microbial CH4 oxidation in modern oxic oceans. Our results also suggest that anoxic microniches in particulate organic matter and phytoplankton cells containing elevated concentrations of precursors of the methyl radical such as DMS may provide potential hotspots for CH4 photoproduction.}

  abstract = {Knowledge on the phenology and distribution of phytoplankton taxonomic groups (PTGs) represent valuable information when studying marine ecosystem, especially in the Arctic Ocean where rapid warming has drastic effects on sea-ice dynamics, which affect the marine food web. Taxonomic groups of phytoplankton can be discriminated based on their pigment signatures, which, in turn, impact their absorption spectra, given that different pigments have different absorption windows in the visible. Using concurrent measurements of phytoplankton diagnostic pigments and absorption spectra (aph) collected in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, a novel and direct approach was designed for simultaneously estimating the biomass concentrations of several PTGs (Ci) as well as their specific absorption coefficient. The chemotaxonomic tool CHEMTAX was applied to twelve diagnostic pigments measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Their results revealed that the phytoplankton community composition was made of nine groups, from which six dominant were identified: diatoms, dinoflagellates, c3-flagellate, haptophytes type 7, two types of prasinophytes. Out of 117 samples, twenty pairs of Ci derived by CHEMTAX and measured aph were randomly selected and used in a linear unmixing model to extract the specific absorption spectral of each group. This step was repeated 1000 times to provide the mean specific absorption of a given phytoplankton group. These specific absorption spectra were used to reconstruct total aph, which was consistent with the measured aph (R2 from 0.8 to 0.95) at all visible wavelengths (400-700 nm). The derived specific absorption spectra were further used with the measured aph({$\lambda$}) at ten Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) wavebands in a linear unmixing model to test the ability to retrieve the concentrations of PTGs from satellite remote sensing. A comparison between estimated and measured Ci showed that the approach used in this study performed best when retrieving five groups (i.e., dinoflagellates, c3-flagellate, haptophytes, two types of prasinophytes) from the nine initially identified using CHEMTAX with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) {$<$}35\%, except for diatoms with a MAPE value of about 45\%. Our approach provides a practical basis for estimation of PTGs using aph({$\lambda$}) derived from satellite observations and field measurements.},

  abstract = {The climate system is a prototypical nonlinear complex system exhibiting nonstationary temporal variation and complicated spatial patterns. One of the ideal locations for studying climate systems is the Qinghai\textendash Tibet Plateau (QTP), which is considered an amplifier of global climate change. In this study, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) was used to analyze the annual temperature series of 17 stations in different climate zones of the QTP, based on station observation data of daily temperature (minimum, maximum and mean) from 1961 to 2008. Spatial patterns and variation of RQA indices of Determinism (DET) and Kolmogorov (K2) entropy suggested that there are marked differences in temperature pattern in the QTP. Correlation analysis between RQA indices of temperature series and environmental factors, such as topographical variation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index suggest that both the source and effect of climate complexity are nonlinear. Results of this study indicate that RQA measurement...},

  abstract = {Flow field-flow fractionation (FlFFF) coupled on-line with UV absorbance and fluorescence detectors was used to examine the colloidal composition and size distribution of optically active dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the lower Mississippi River (MR), the East Pearl River (EPR), the St. Louis Bay (SLB) estuary, and coastal waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico. In addition to field studies, laboratory mixing experiments using river and seawater end-members were carried out to study the processes controlling the estuarine mixing behavior and size partitioning of colloids with different sizes and composition. The colloidal size spectra of chromophoric DOM and humic-like DOM showed one dominant peak in the 0.5-4 nm size range, representing {$>$}75\% of the total FlFFF-recoverable colloids. In contrast, protein-like DOM showed a bi-modal distribution with peaks at 0.5-4 nm and 4-8 nm, as well as a major portion (from {\~ }41\% in the EPR to {\~ }72\% in the Mississippi Bight) partitioned to the {$>$}20 nm size fraction. Bulk DOM was lower in abundance and molecular-weight in the MR compared with the EPR, while the proportion of colloidal protein-like DOM in the {$>$}20 nm size range was slightly larger in the MR compared with the EPR. These features are consistent with differences in land use, hydrological conditions, and water residence time between the two river basins, with more autochthonous DOM in MR waters. In the SLB estuary, different DOM components demonstrated different mixing behaviors. The abundance of colloidal chromophoric DOM decreased with increasing salinity and showed evident removal during estuarine mixing even though the bulk DOM appeared to be conservative. In contrast, colloidal humic-like DOM behaved conservatively inside SLB and during laboratory mixing experiments. The ratio of colloidal protein-like to humic-like DOM generally increased with increasing salinity, consistent with increasing autochthonous protein-like DOM and removal of terrestrially-derived humic-like DOM in estuarine and coastal waters. Similar mixing behavior for the bulk DOM and colloids was observed in short-term laboratory mixing experiments, suggesting that physicochemical processes are the major controlling factor for colloidal removal in the estuary. For the first time, this study showed direct evidence of contrasting estuarine mixing behavior for different size fractions of optically active colloidal DOM.},

  abstract = {This protocol document aims to support the ocean color community with protocols for the collection, processing and quality assurance of in situ measurements of the apparent optical properties of natural water for the validation of satellite radiometric products. In addition to a general introduction on Elements of Marine Optical Radiometry Data and Analysis (Chapter 1), the document addresses Radiometers Specifications (Chapter 2), Calibration and Characterization of Optical Radiometers (Chapter 3), In-water Radiometry Measurements and Data Analysis (Chapter 4), and Above-water Radiometry Measurements and Data Analysis (Chapter 5). The overall structure and content of the various chapters are based on, and benefit from, the Ocean Optics Protocols promoted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration within the framework of the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Sensor Intercomparison for Marine Biological and Interdisciplinary Ocean Studies (SIMBIOS) programs (Mueller and Austin 1995, Mueller et al. 2003a, Mueller et al. 2003b). It is emphasized that, by recognizing optical radiometry can be heavily affected by the presence of clouds which will unavoidably challenge the quantification of measurement uncertainties, the protocols put emphasis only on measurements performed during clear sky conditions, which are those relevant for the validation of satellite ocean color data products. Finally, it is anticipated that the chapters on in-water and above-water radiometry provide comprehensive details on those measurement methods sharing large consensus inside the community and whose application is strongly encouraged. Conversely, brief summaries are only provided for those methods already well represented by the previous ones or for those methods that may exhibit difficult implementation in a variety of measurement conditions.}

  abstract = {Radium-bearing barite (radiobarite) is a common constituent of scale and sludge deposits that form in oil-field production equipment. The barite forms as a precipitate from radium-bearing, saline formation water that is pumped to the surface along with oil. Radioactivity levels in some oil-field equipment and in soils contaminated by scale and sludge can be sufficiently high to pose a potential health threat. Accurate determinations of radium isotopes (226Ra+228Ra) in soils are required to establish the level of soil contamination and the volume of soil that may exceed regulatory limits for total radium content. In this study the radium isotopic data are used to provide estimates of the age of formation of the radiobarite contaminant. Age estimates require that highly insoluble radiobarite approximates a chemically closed system from the time of its formation. Age estimates are based on the decay of short-lived 228Ra (half-life=5.76 years) compared to 226Ra (half-life=1600 years). Present activity ratios of 228Ra/226Ra in radiobarite-rich scale or highly contaminated soil are compared to initial ratios at the time of radiobarite precipitation. Initial ratios are estimated by measurements of saline water or recent barite precipitates at the site or by considering a range of probable initial ratios based on reported values in modern oil-field brines. At sites that contain two distinct radiobarite sources of different age, the soils containing mixtures of sources can be identified, and mixing proportions quantified using radium concentration and isotopic data. These uses of radium isotope data provide more description of contamination history and can possibly address liability issues. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2000 .},
