There are now more and more peer-reviewed open access journals where scientific research can be disseminated. That is why, as an academic, I recently decided to only review articles that are going to be published in open access journals. I will also strongly encourage the publication of my future articles in open access journals when I am the first author.  \n\n## The Directory of Open Access Journal (DOAJ)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='index_cache/html/download_data_a9eca0a141e68d85b0e324da4fb7d2f3'}\n\n:::\n\n\nI recently discovered that the [Directory of Open Access Journal](https://doaj.org/) provides a curated list of high-quality open access journals. At this time, there are 18048 journals indexed in their database. I found out that I could use this source of information to help me to find appropriate open access journals for my future research articles. DOAJ provides a list of their indexed journals as well as the countries in which they are published. I was interested to explore this data to know which countries publish open access journals. The following graph shows the first 20 countries listed in DOAJ in which open access journals are published. I was quite surprised to see that Indonesia was the country that publishes the most open access journals.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='index_cache/html/open_journal_per_country_aeeed1285480e1c6cd191d0167b46f77'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/open_journal_per_country-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> Indonesia may be the world's OA leader: the study found that 81% of ﻿20,000 journal articles published in 2017 with an Indonesia-affiliated author are available to read for free somewhere online, and 74% are published with open-access licences, meaning they could be legally redistributed (see ‘Open-access leaders’).\n*https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01536-5*\n\nThe number of open access journals in each country is presented in the following table.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='index_cache/html/open_journal_per_country_table_4bf9c8bd2a5b156e8ebcb8d36393316f'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-36fbd44715145484fe89\" class=\"reactable html-widget\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-36fbd44715145484fe89\">{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"country_of_publisher\":[\"Åland Islands\",\"Albania\",\"Algeria\",\"Angola\",\"Argentina\",\"Armenia\",\"Australia\",\"Austria\",\"Azerbaijan\",\"Bahamas\",\"Bahrain\",\"Bangladesh\",\"Barbados\",\"Belarus\",\"Belgium\",\"Bolivia, Plurinational State of\",\"Bosnia and Herzegovina\",\"Brazil\",\"Bulgaria\",\"Cameroon\",\"Canada\",\"Chile\",\"China\",\"Colombia\",\"Congo, The Democratic Republic of the\",\"Costa Rica\",\"Côte d'Ivoire\",\"Croatia\",\"Cuba\",\"Cyprus\",\"Czechia\",\"Denmark\",\"Dominican Republic\",\"Ecuador\",\"Egypt\",\"El Salvador\",\"Estonia\",\"Ethiopia\",\"Finland\",\"France\",\"Gambia\",\"Georgia\",\"Germany\",\"Ghana\",\"Greece\",\"Guadeloupe\",\"Guam\",\"Guatemala\",\"Honduras\",\"Hong Kong\",\"Hungary\",\"Iceland\",\"India\",\"Indonesia\",\"Iran, Islamic Republic of\",\"Iraq\",\"Ireland\",\"Israel\",\"Italy\",\"Japan\",\"Jordan\",\"Kazakhstan\",\"Kenya\",\"Korea, Republic of\",\"Kuwait\",\"Kyrgyzstan\",\"Latvia\",\"Lebanon\",\"Libya\",\"Lithuania\",\"Luxembourg\",\"Malawi\",\"Malaysia\",\"Mali\",\"Malta\",\"Mexico\",\"Moldova, Republic of\",\"Mongolia\",\"Montenegro\",\"Morocco\",\"Nepal\",\"Netherlands\",\"New Zealand\",\"Nicaragua\",\"Nigeria\",\"North Macedonia\",\"Norway\",\"Oman\",\"Pakistan\",\"Palestine, State of\",\"Panama\",\"Paraguay\",\"Peru\",\"Philippines\",\"Poland\",\"Portugal\",\"Puerto Rico\",\"Qatar\",\"Romania\",\"Russian Federation\",\"Rwanda\",\"Saudi Arabia\",\"Serbia\",\"Singapore\",\"Slovakia\",\"Slovenia\",\"South Africa\",\"South Sudan\",\"Spain\",\"Sri Lanka\",\"Sweden\",\"Switzerland\",\"Syrian Arab Republic\",\"Taiwan, Province of China\",\"Thailand\",\"Trinidad and Tobago\",\"Tunisia\",\"Turkey\",\"Turkmenistan\",\"Uganda\",\"Ukraine\",\"United Arab Emirates\",\"United Kingdom\",\"United States\",\"Uruguay\",\"Uzbekistan\",\"Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of\",\"Viet Nam\",\"Yemen\",\"Zimbabwe\"],\"n\":[1,4,25,4,348,8,127,53,1,1,1,22,1,21,53,8,38,1621,81,1,200,149,194,420,3,72,2,147,125,3,133,39,7,84,61,4,34,8,63,281,1,4,334,6,44,1,1,3,4,18,62,6,325,2001,695,79,17,3,480,75,1,19,6,160,1,3,12,2,5,101,2,1,91,1,2,203,38,6,9,28,25,381,20,11,17,15,120,7,104,1,5,25,120,20,777,154,4,12,364,545,1,18,211,38,50,64,125,1,930,20,47,531,11,34,29,1,5,418,1,1,408,9,1947,1036,32,2,35,11,6,1]},\"columns\":[{\"accessor\":\"country_of_publisher\",\"name\":\"Country\",\"type\":\"character\",\"filterable\":true},{\"accessor\":\"n\",\"name\":\"Number of open journals\",\"type\":\"numeric\"}],\"defaultPageSize\":10,\"paginationType\":\"numbers\",\"showPageInfo\":true,\"minRows\":1,\"dataKey\":\"6d5ae249fb74e580139a7c4b68fd47dc\"},\"children\":[]},\"class\":\"reactR_markup\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## A global overview\n\nThe next map shows a global overview of the number of published open access journals around the world.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='index_cache/html/country_sf_8e427c8cc85d9c176ed0debefc424f32'}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='index_cache/html/make_plot_ff3ffe8144ce7aa968e953b3adc90c83'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/make_plot-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The big five publishers\n\nAccording to a [paper published in 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502), *Elsevier*, *Springer*, *Wiley*, *Taylor & Francis Group* and *SAGE Publishing* are the main publishers that control more than half of the market of scientific. In the past few years, many universities and institutions have started to [boycott these big publishers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cost_of_Knowledge). Using the DOAJ's data, I was interested to see if how these publishers embraced the open access movement. Not too surprisingly, we can see a peak in the creation of open access journals between 2013 and 2015.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='index_cache/html/big_five_1_03eabd101faff7599575501aa062419f'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/big_five_1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='index_cache/html/big_five_publishing_cost_33ccb255ee12911323a1bc1125d10a28'}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='index_cache/html/plot_submission_fee_9455380f65918e9ed5dcc8daab8c6a4a'}\n\n:::\n",
